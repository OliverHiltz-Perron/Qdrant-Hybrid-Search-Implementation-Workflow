# a. Acronyms and Definitions:

- ARBest: Arkansas Building Effective Services for Trauma is a state funded program at the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences, Psychiatric Research Institute.
- CACD: Crimes Against Children Division – A division of the Arkansas State Police that investigates most Priority 1 (generally severe maltreatment) investigations.
- CEBC: California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse
- CHRIS: Arkansas’s current SACWIS system
- DCFS: Division of Children and Family Services
- D.R.: Differential Response is an alternative response to allegations of child maltreatment. There is no investigation or investigative finding. D.R. is designed to engage families in order to connect them to formal and informal community supports and services. D.R. aims to safely reduce the number of children entering foster care and prevent future occurrence of child maltreatment.
- EBP: Evidence-Based Practice
- FSW: Family Service Worker – The FSW is the frontline DCFS staff. They can work ps cases, ss cases, fc cases, and investigations; however, DCFS often refers to FSW’s who work investigations as investigators. FSW and caseworker are used interchangeably.
- FFPSA: Family First Prevention Services Act (also referred to below as “the Act” or Family First)
- The Hotline: The Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline receives all allegations of child abuse/neglect and decides if they meet the requirements for an investigation, a DR, or are screened out (screened out referrals are documented, but not sent to anyone). The hotline also determines if the allegations are a Priority 1 or 2 and if they go to DCFS or CACD. The Hotline is run by the State Police.
- Priority 1: certain allegations of child abuse/neglect that require a 24-hour response time to see the victim children face to face.
- Priority 2: certain allegations of child abuse/neglect that require a 72-hour response time to see the victim children face to face.
- PS Case: Protective Services Case – A case opened due to an investigation with a true finding. These are in-home cases with no removal.
- SS Case: Supportive Services Case – A case opened through an avenue other than a true finding on an investigation. These cases are “voluntary” on the part of the parents (examples: a parent requests services, a Judge orders DCFS to provide services through a FINS case, an investigation is unsubstantiated, but the family agrees to services, a family involved with DR needs services past the DR time frame.)
- True Finding: An investigation has been completed, and it is determined there is a preponderance of evidence to support the allegation of child abuse/neglect.
- Unsubstantiated: An investigation has been completed, and it is determined there is not a preponderance of evidence to support the allegation of child abuse/neglect.



# b. Introduction

Four years ago, Arkansas was in crisis. There were alarmingly high numbers of children in care, unmanageable caseloads, and a lack of fundamental supports for families and DCFS staff. The Division set out on an aggressive but strategic plan to tackle a growing crisis in its child welfare and foster care system.

First, Paul Vincent, the Director of the Child Welfare Policy and Practice Group, was asked to complete a review of the Arkansas Division of Children and Family Services. His report was released in July 2015 and included 10 recommendations to help the Division respond to the crisis and create a stronger child welfare system. Then, the Department of Human Services (DHS) pulled together staff from across the agency in addition to child welfare experts and stakeholders to help DCFS address the foster care crisis and how to implement the recommended changes.

In Phase One, outlined in the division’s first annual report Moving Beyond the Crisis, DCFS identified the key systemic issues and a plan for triage. By September 2017, the number of children in foster care had stopped rising, caseloads had declined, and families felt more supported. It seemed that the crisis had peaked, but there was still more work to be done.

Phase Two began with the release of a report called Renewed Hope. This report focused on three key areas of improvement: (1) Strengthening families so children can remain safely at home and families are more resilient, (2) Improving the foster care system so that it is stable for those who need it, and (3) Building, supporting, and empowering a strong DCFS workforce. Renewed Hope was designed to begin laying the groundwork for long-term, positive, and sustainable improvements.

Over the past year, DCFS began Phase Three with a continued focus on the three overarching buckets of focus. Though not all goals have been achieved, the Division is healthier and has a stronger foundation on which to complete the next phase of work. Below are just some on the gains DCFS has made since 2016.

- The average caseload for a frontline worker decreased from 28 cases in 2016 to 18.7 in June 2019.
- The number of overdue child maltreatment investigations is down from 721 in 2016 to 112 in June 2019.
- The number of children in foster care in Arkansas dropped from 5,196 in late 2016 to 4,327 today, a 17-percent decline and the lowest since the crisis response began.
- The percentage of children who are placed with relatives is up from 23 percent in 2016 to 30 percent today.
- The percentage of children placed in family-like settings is up from 78 percent in 2016 to 87 percent today.
- The ratio of foster home beds to children in care is up from 0.69 in 2016 to 0.81 today.

All the work the Division has been undergoing is underpinned by the DCFS value that children do best in families, and every child deserves a safe, stable, and nurturing family every day. Due to the hard work over the last three years, the Division is in a strong position to implement Family First Prevention Services Act (“Family First” or FFPSA) as it is already in line with its vision and goals.

One of the lessons learned over the past three years is that DCFS leadership must help workers think critically about the work that needs to be done to support children and families. To do that, DCFS established a central office Prevention and Reunification Unit. By 2018, DCFS was able to fully staff the new unit through more positions and funding approved by Governor Asa Hutchinson and the State Legislature. These positions are in addition to many other new positions all across the state that help support prevention and reunification efforts. There is now an Assistant Director to oversee the unit as well as a manager and program specialist for each program area. The unit provides support, training, coaching, and technical assistance to field staff for D.R., Investigations, and In-Home cases. The unit also focuses on family reunification once a child is in foster care. This unit places an intense focus on building families up so that their children never need to come into foster care.


# Strengthening Families

In order to truly strengthen families, Division staff must know what families need. DCFS created the Parent Advisory Council in June 2018 to help the Prevention and Reunification Unit with the following:

- Build partnerships between parents and staff;
- Promote parent leadership development;
- Help expand the meaningful roles of parents throughout the system.

The creation of the council ensures strong parent voices are included in the shaping of programs, services, and strategies.

To reach the goal of strengthening families, DCFS has focused on giving parents the tools and knowledge that would both help prevent abuse/neglect, as well as providing them with the skills necessary to get their children back and keep them safe. As part of this effort, DCFS expanded some of the services rolled out in 2016 and increased access and quality of existing services.

# Expanding Programs and Services

In recent years, DCFS started several programs that use a team-based approach to determine the safety and permanency of children who interact with the child welfare system that engage families in ways that were not common in the state’s system prior. To ensure these programs would result in stronger families and be better for Arkansas children, DCFS limited the scope or reach of these programs to certain areas or types of cases. Now DCFS is ready to expand those programs with the overall goal of preventing future maltreatment and increasing the family’s capacity to care for children safely at home (and thereby preventing the need for foster care intervention). Those programs include: Team Decision Making, SafeCare, and Nurturing the Families of Arkansas.

# Creating New Programs to Ensure Parents Have Access to Services

DCFS continues to see a need for more intensive and one-on-one programs that can provide parents with concrete steps and information that will lead to thriving parents and long-term family stability. DCFS launched two new programs at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019.

The Baby and Me WIC clinic project is a new pilot program that launched October 1, 2018. The Director of the Children’s Trust Fund, which is part of the Prevention and Reunification Unit, worked with the Arkansas Department of Health to develop this program for pregnant women and new moms who are getting services through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).

When the women visit a WIC clinic to receive or renew their benefits, a trained parent support mentor will provide one-on-one sessions that will include a brief health and safety lesson, a check of the baby’s developmental milestones, and activities that promote parent-child bonding. The topics covered in the curriculum were selected because they are closely related to the leading causes of infant death and injuries in the state. The seven modules of the program include:

- Safe Sleep Practices
- Dealing with Infant Crying
- Importance of Routines
- Handling Stress and Depression
- Home Safety
- Preparing for Discipline
- Understanding Developmental Milestones

Parents are also connected to community services and supports as needed and receive diapers and wipes for each module of the program they complete.

The pilot started in 6 counties and has now grown to 14 counties. The project is being evaluated through a contract with the Department of Family and Preventative Medicine, Research, and Evaluation Division at UAMS.




# Intensive In-home Services

Intensive In-home Services is a new program to help prevent placing kids in foster care or get them back home quickly and safely. These new services, which will be offered by DHS contractors, will focus on helping stabilize families for the long-term instead on the immediate crisis of the moment. The goal is to safely reduce the number of children in care by providing in-home services.

Phase One of the effort to improve Arkansas’s child welfare system was largely successful at stabilizing the system and preventing a breakdown of the system. Phase Two built upon those efforts and focused on putting initiatives, programs, and practices in place to ensure that the system and the people within and around it are stronger, stable, supported, and empowered to make smarter, more effective decisions. That work built the foundation for this past year of Phase Three and the future of child welfare in Arkansas. This solid footing, grounded in a continued emphasis on safety, permanency, and well-being for the children and families served, will allow the Division to push forward with programs and partnerships that have shown success. It also allows DCFS to try new initiatives that hold real promise for the future. With the continued support of the Governor, the Legislature, and community partners, as well as the amazing dedication and passion of DCFS frontline and support staff, the Division is poised to make a real difference in the lives of the people that it serves every day. While the Division has been making a concerted effort to increase prevention services, Family First creates an exciting opportunity for DCFS to leverage resources and expand access to evidence-based practices that would otherwise not be achievable.

# II. Title IV - E Prevention Services

# Description and Oversight

Pre-Print Section 1

Arkansas has worked hard the past several years to build its prevention services and In-Home program prioritizing evidence-based services that meet the needs of families and help to keep kids safely in their homes. Family First offers an opportunity to continue and expand some of the existing services and expand the array of evidence-based services. Below are the programs Arkansas has identified to best meet the needs of its clients. DCFS has started this transformation with in-home parenting programs but will include Mental Health and Substance Abuse services and programs in the future as the Division expands implementation of Family First. Arkansas is working with the National Council on Crime and Delinquency (NCCD) to complete the independent systematic review of each service as necessary to claim transitional payments.

# a. In-Home Parenting

SafeCare – SafeCare is a home visiting program with more than 30 years of research supporting its effectiveness at reducing child abuse and neglect and strengthening positive parenting skills. The parent-skill based intervention is for parents or caretakers of children ages zero to five. SafeCare is module based and delivered over 18-22 sessions. The three modules address three risk factors that can lead to child abuse and neglect: 1) The parent-child relationship, 2) home safety, and 3) caring for the health of young children. Each module includes a baseline assessment, intervention (training sessions), and a follow-up assessment to monitor progress over the course of the program. SafeCare is trauma informed and is a clearly defined and replicable program.

DCFS has a partnership with Arkansas Children’s Hospital (ACH). ACH is responsible for the provision of SafeCare in central Arkansas and through subcontracts with local providers across the state. They are supported by the National SafeCare Training and Research Center, which monitors fidelity and grants accreditation. Arkansas’s SafeCare received accreditation in April 2019.




# SafeCare Overview

SafeCare is under the umbrella of the Arkansas Home Visiting Network; unlike other home visiting programs in the network, it is exclusively for DCFS clients. It is currently in all ten of the division’s geographic areas, though they are not accepting referrals yet in three of those counties. Training for DCFS staff is planned for Jan., Feb., and March in those three counties.1 SafeCare is currently funded by Medicaid, but DCFS will provide a 15% match starting Oct. 1, 2019. DCFS will assume full responsibility for payments on Oct. 1, 2020. As such, DCFS will not be asking for reimbursement on SafeCare until FFY 2021. However, DCFS is requesting that the 15% state match spent on SafeCare in FFY 2020 count towards the 50% state expenditures on well-supported programs.

# Referral Criteria

Current referral criteria for SafeCare includes a child who is the subject of a Garrett’s Law investigation or a protective services case is open due to a true finding of medical neglect, failure to thrive, Munchausen by Proxy, or other neglect categories. As SafeCare started prior to the passage of Family First, candidacy and/or Family First eligibility was not initially included in the eligibility criteria; however, this will be a requirement starting Oct. 1, 2019. This should not have a negative impact on referrals as a review of SafeCare clients showed that 96% of referrals met Arkansas’s definition of candidacy. Once, DCFS assumes payment the PIs will be changed so that SafeCare can also be provided to parenting foster youth who do not have a true determination of maltreatment. SafeCare has not been rated by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse at this time but is scheduled to be reviewed. DCFS believes that SafeCare meets the standards set forth in the Family First Services and Prevention Act2 as a well-supported practice. Below are 4 relevant studies.3

# Nurturing Parenting Program

NPP is an evidence-based, trauma-informed in-home parenting program. Nurturing the Families of Arkansas (NFA) is Arkansas’s version of the Nurturing Parenting Program, a program for parents and caregivers involved in in-home cases with children between the ages of 5-18, though exceptions can be made for children 0-4. The 16-week program is administered in groups and/or individually and is designed to build and strengthen positive parenting skills. By providing parents with improved parenting techniques, NFA aims to safely reduce the number of children entering the foster care system and decrease future involvement with DCFS.

As part of Arkansas’s IV-E waiver initiative, NFA was Arkansas’s first evidence-based prevention program. The evaluation of the program concluded that NFA had positive outcomes for children and families in Arkansas including reducing future maltreatment and removal into foster care. Arkansas saw the best outcomes for families who had a D.R. and then subsequently had a protective services (PS) case where NFA was provided. After seeing these results, referral criteria were changed to allow for NFA to be provided through a supportive services case. This allows NFA to be provided to appropriate families from a DR/supportive services case and hopefully prevent a true finding from ever occurring. Arkansas also updated referral criteria to allow a parenting foster care youth who is placed with their child to participate in NFA. Due to this change, NFA trained their staff on NPP curriculum for the 0-4 age group in the winter of 2019. The evaluation also showed that parents who completed the program consistently had.

Positive feedback regarding the program and the staff. Because of the positive feedback received and the measurable outcomes for families, Arkansas had planned to continue this EBP. NFA is already available in all 75 counties.

NPP was developed in 1983 and based around the 6 protective factors: Nurturing and Attachment, Knowledge of Parenting and Child Development, Parental Resilience, Social Connections, Concrete Support Services for Parents, and Social and Emotional Competence of Children. The lessons provided address inappropriate parenting expectations, lack of empathy, strong belief in use of corporal punishment, inappropriate family roles, and oppressing children’s power and independence.

Assessments are completed pre, during, and post services to measure differences in a parent’s knowledge, skills, and parenting beliefs.

NPP has 30 years of research supporting its effectiveness in the treatment and prevention of child abuse and neglect. NPP is currently being reviewed by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse. Despite it being on the list for review, Arkansas decided to continue with an independent systematic review as receiving transitional payments for this service will assist DCFS in implementing Family First by Oct. 1, 2019. Unfortunately, the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse has completed their review and determined the current research does not meet the Family First criteria for a promising, supported, or well-supported practice. Arkansas DCFS is partnering with our current provider of NFA to determine the best course of action that will meet the needs of the children and families we serve. At this time, we are exploring Triple P as it is being reviewed by the Title IV-E Clearinghouse.

# Intensive In-Home

Arkansas implemented Intensive In-Home Services in February 2019. This is a pilot program in 37 counties. Arkansas identified a gap in its service array, for families that needed intensive services for longer than four to six weeks to help them achieve stability and maintain gains. Arkansas wanted a program that was similar to its Intensive Family Services, but in addition to crisis intervention, provided longer-term support to help families achieve the necessary skills and social support network to maintain long-term stabilization. Arkansas put out an RFQ with the parameters that needed to be met including length of service and expected outcomes, but requested the providers propose the evidence-based intervention used to deliver the service. Arkansas chose three different providers that presented different intervention models. Below are the interventions (additional information on Intensive In-Home Services can also be found in Arkansas’s 2020-2024 Child and Family Services Plan Goal 2, Strategy 4.

For a family to be eligible for Intensive In-Home Services they must have an open in-home case where at least one child is a candidate for foster care or an open foster care case where intensive services is needed for reunification to be successful. While not the target population, any of the Intensive In-Home programs may be appropriate for a parenting foster youth, if their needs cannot be met by NFA or SafeCare once available.

# YVIntercept™

YVIntercept™ is the model developed and used by Youth Villages. It is an integrated approach to in-home parenting skill development that offers a variety of evidence-based practices to meet the individualized needs of a family and young person. Specifically, it employs the following evidence-based practices, as clinically indicated: Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (ACRA), Community Advocacy Project (CAP), Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS), Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), and Motivational Interviewing. This program is a trauma.




informed in-home services program providing family-centered treatment with strength-based interventions. This comprehensive intervention takes a therapeutic approach to parenting skills education, educational interventions, development of positive peer groups, and extensive help for families and children in accessing community resources and long-term, ongoing support.

Family intervention specialists work with both the child and the caregivers to address issues that are impacting the stability of the family, meeting with children and caregivers a minimum of two-three times weekly depending on family need and providing families with access to 24-hour on-call support. Services are tailored to meet each family’s needs, ongoing assessments and reviews measure progress throughout the intervention.

The goals of the program are to reduce subsequent maltreatment, prevent foster care placement, and reduce time in state custody by successfully reuniting children with their families in a timelier manner. The length of treatment is determined by the needs of the family and their progress. However, diversion services generally last four to six months, while reunification services generally last six to nine months.

YVIntercept™ is currently available in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Ohio, Oregon, and Tennessee.

YVIntercept™ was recently the subject of a rigorous evaluation by an independent third party that examined whether YVIntercept™ (1) reduced the risk of placement into foster care among children who were at risk of placement having never been in out of home care previously, and (2) affected the rate of permanency, time to permanency, and re-entry into care for children referred to the program while in foster care. Arkansas contracted with NCCD to complete an independent systematic review in order to receive transitional payments for this service. NCCD determined a rating of Supported for Intercept.⁶

Youth Villages has implemented Intercept™ in 9 counties in north central and eastern parts of Arkansas. There is only one version of Intercept.

There is only one version of Intercept and it is clearly defined and replicable. The Youth Villages website includes information regarding training and certification, implementation support and documentation. There is also an online clinical portal that is proprietary and accessible only to staff who are trained in the model. The document that describes this process and the online clinical portal tool can be found directly here: Clinical Process Document.

The following is the relevant study which demonstrates the effectiveness of Intercept.

# Family Centered Treatment

Family Centered Treatment (FCT) is a strength-based, trauma-informed, and evidence-based family preservation model that provides services to families directly in their homes. FCT is designed to find simple, practical, and common-sense solutions for families faced with disruption or dissolution of their family.

6 See Appendix C. Attachment V: Required Documentation of Independent Systematic Review for Transitional Payments.




# Family Centered Treatment (FCT)

This program follows a four-stage process of Joining and Assessment, Restructuring, Valuing Changes, and Generalization. The length of treatment is determined by the family’s needs and progress, but the average length of treatment is six months. The foundations of FCT are grounded in Eco-Structural Family Therapy and Emotionally Focused Therapy. FCT is clearly defined and replicable. The Family Centered Treatment Foundation has a best practice implementation process that allows prospective and current licensed FCT providers to identify and plan for sustainable implementation. FCT has not been evaluated by the Title IV-E Clearinghouse; however, Arkansas contracted with NCCD to complete an independent systematic review in order to receive transitional payments for this service. NCCD determined a rating of Well-Supported for FCT.⁷

St. Francis Ministries has implemented FCT in 15 counties in the Northern and Eastern parts of Arkansas.

Youth Advocate Programs (YAP) has implemented a different model to provide Intensive In-Home Services; however, after the results of the Independent Systematic Review, YAP is currently working on switching their model to FCT. YAP is servicing an additional 13 counties in the Northern and Southern parts of Arkansas.

Once YAP is trained and implementing FCT, roughly a third of the state will have access to this well-supported practice.

There is only one version of FCT. The manuals used for implementation are The Wheels of Change: The Family Centered specialist’s handbook and training manual©- William E. Painter Jr. and Mario Smith and Family Centered Treatment® Design and Implementation Guide- Tim Wood.

# Intensive Family Services

Arkansas currently provides Intensive Family Services (IFS) in 23 counties. IFS is a four to six-week intensive in-home service to improve parenting skills, parent-child relationships, and prevent children from coming into foster care. IFS is delivered by six different providers across the state. Current IFS providers are not required to be accredited by or to otherwise utilize an evidence-based model. As the current contract for IFS ends June 30, 2019, Arkansas has researched evidence-based models and selected Homebuilders® as the required evidence-based model for the RFP. Homebuilders is extremely similar to the current model allowing for an easy transition for DCFS staff and providers.

7 See Appendix C, Attachment V: Required Documentation of Independent Systematic Review for Transitional Payments




# Homebuilders®

Homebuilders® has a rigorous amount of research supporting its effectiveness and systems in place for the implementation of and maintaining fidelity to the model.

As the current IFS is not a specified model, Arkansas will not claim reimbursement for IFS until July 2020, and HomeBuilders® is rated on the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse. However, IFS will already be an option in the family’s prevention plan. As the population IFS serves will remain the same, this will help DCFS plan for cost and refining candidacy and referral criteria.

# Homebuilders®

Homebuilders® is a home and community-based intensive family preservation service designed to avoid unnecessary placement of children in foster care, group care, psychiatric hospitals, or juvenile justice facilities. When working with families involved in child welfare due to neglect, activities focus on improving the physical condition of the home, improving supervision, decreasing parental depression and/or alcohol and substance abuse, and helping families access needed community supports. This program is typically delivered in a four to six-week time frame and serves families with children ages 0-17. Homebuilders® is clearly defined, replicable, and formal support is available for implementation. Homebuilders® is set to be reviewed by the Title IV-E clearinghouse, and Arkansas believes that Homebuilders® will meet the criteria for a well-supported practice. DCFS did not include this service to be in its independent systematic review because it should be rated by the Title IV-E Clearinghouse prior to the implementation of the service. The following are relevant studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of Homebuilders®.

# Teaching Family Model (TFM)

While Arkansas is not currently procuring a contract for the Teaching Family Model, it will be considered in the future for expansion of Family First. TFM is a unique approach to human services that uses “teaching parents” to model positive healthy parenting, living, and interpersonal interaction skills. This program is designed to be provided in any residential setting. When implementing TFM as a home-based diversion program, the model calls for 10-15 sessions a week for 6-10 weeks. TFM is trauma informed, clearly defined, and replicable with formal support for implementation. There are providers in Arkansas who currently provide TFM in residential settings and are interested in providing TFM as a diversion program in partnership with DCFS. TFM is currently not rated by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse, but Arkansas



believes that it meets the definition of a well-supported practice under Family First.⁸ The following shows relevant research demonstrating the effectiveness of TFM.

| Proven track record of helping to reduce the number of children in foster care in Tennessee and has experience providing prevention services in multiple states. Uses evidence-based interventions with a stringent supervision model. Meets a gap in the DCFS service array.                                                                                                                                       | Formal Contracted Evaluation |
| St. Francis has had success in providing Family Centered Treatment in two other states. This model addresses the needs of families with a trauma-informed and evidence-based service. St. Francis included in their proposal an understanding of the challenges and impact of community poverty which is important as some of the counties where they provide services are some of the poorest areas in the nation. | Formal Contracted Evaluation |




 b. Mental Health

Arkansas recognizes that evidence-based mental health services are critical to the populations it serves. Furthermore, DCFS wants to continue to improve the quality of mental health services available to clients. Mental health treatment for adults and children involved with child welfare are mainly covered through Medicaid and private insurance. Many DCFS clients already have Medicaid and workers can help eligible clients apply if they do not have coverage or their coverage has lapsed. DCFS does have small contracts for counseling services for those children and caregivers who do not have coverage. These contracts are for counseling agencies and/or private licensed providers.

The Division’s current counseling contracts do not specify that therapists must be certified to provide specific therapies. While DCFS will not amend its contracts to require certification in the below therapeutic modalities, as that would be too limiting on providers and clients, the contract PIs will be revised to encourage providers to be trained in these approaches. DCFS is also changing the format of the providers’ monthly reports. Providers will now report not only which clients they see and whether or not the payor source is Medicaid, DCFS contract, or other, but also if they are using one of the specified trauma-informed, evidence-based therapies listed in the Division’s IV-E Prevention Program Five-Year Plan, and if the client is eligible under Family First. DCFS recognizes that not all of clients will be appropriate for one of these therapies, that not all mental health diagnoses have a corresponding evidence-based therapy as a best practice standard of care, and that some clients may need an evidence-based therapy that is currently not included in the plan. For these reasons, DCFS is not limiting its contracted therapists to these treatment modalities. In addition, providers may choose to add to their monthly report other evidence-based therapies they are providing which may lead to other evidence-based therapies added to Arkansas’s IV-E Prevention Program Five-Year Plan.

In the past, DCFS has partnered with ARBest to help educate DCFS staff on Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) and increase the use of this therapy for children in foster care. ARBest is a state-funded program through the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences, Psychiatric Research Institute which aims to improve outcomes for traumatized children and families through excellence in clinical care, training, advocacy, and evaluation. In addition to the work ARBest has done in regard to TF-CBT, they also provide training for therapists in the evidence-based, trauma-informed practices of Parent Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and Parent Child Psychotherapy (CPP). ARBest keeps an up-to-date register of therapists in Arkansas who are able to provide each of these therapies. Because of the respected work ARBest is already doing in the state and the strong partnership between ARBest and DCFS, the Division included these therapies in its IV-E Prevention Program Five-Year Plan. DCFS also chose Functional Family Therapy (FFT) to include in the plan. While ARBest does not provide training for this intervention, FFT is well-supported and specifically addresses the needs of older youth and their families.

# Trauma Focused-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)

TF-CBT is a trauma informed evidence-based mental health treatment for children and adolescents who have experienced trauma from events such as sexual or physical abuse. TF-CBT is considered the gold-standard in treatment for child trauma. TF-CBT aims to reduce trauma symptoms while strengthening the parent-child relationship. The Title IV-E Clearinghouse has rated TF-CBT as a promising practice. As such, Arkansas will not be requesting reimbursement for this service until such a time as it becomes well-supported according to the federal clearinghouse or Arkansas is able to do an independent evaluation.

# Parent Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT)

PCIT is an evidence-based dyadic behavioral intervention for children ages two through seven and their parents or caregivers. The treatment focuses on decreasing externalized disruptive behavior in young children with a history of trauma. This treatment has been shown to improve parent-child attachment, reducing symptoms of trauma in children, and improvements


# Current Services

in children’s behavior. PCIT is currently rated as Well-Supported on the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse. DCFS has contracts across the state with multiple counseling agencies. PCIT is provided by several therapists in these various agencies. All therapists providing PCIT have been certified in PCIT with The Parent-Child Interaction Therapy Protocol- Eyberg, S. & Funderburk, B. (2011) Parent-Child Interaction Therapy Protocol: 2011. PCIT International, Inc. This is the manual used in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse review of PCIT. ARBest provides the training for PCIT which involves an 18-month process including a four-day in-person training, a two day follow up training, and 18 months of consultation calls held weekly and requiring the completion of two full PCIT cases. PCIT also requires agency support for therapists. Contracted therapists providing PCIT must show proof of training and fidelity to the model. The DCFS Assistant Director of Mental Health provides contract oversight and CQI of contracted mental health providers. In addition to monthly reports, quarterly meetings are held to discuss issues and address barriers and the DCFS Assistant Director of Mental Health also completes quarterly Vendor Performance Reports. Arkansas will not be requesting reimbursement for this service at this time.

# Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)

CPT is a trauma-informed cognitive behavioral treatment for PTSD in adults. It has shown to be effective in reducing PTSD symptoms to a variety of traumatic events such as rape, abuse, and events of war. CPT is endorsed by the U.S. Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense as a best practice for the treatment of PTSD. In order to increase the number of CPT-trained therapists in Arkansas, ARBest began providing CPT training in 2019. The Title IV-E Clearinghouse has not yet rated CPT. As such, Arkansas will not be requesting reimbursement for this service until such a time as it becomes well-supported according to the federal clearinghouse or Arkansas is able to do an independent evaluation.

# Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP)

CPP is a trauma-informed, evidence-based treatment for young children (ages zero through five) who have experienced trauma. It has been shown to be effective at reducing emotional and behavioral difficulties associated with trauma, strengthen the parent-child relationship, and enhance safe caregiving practices. The Title IV-E Clearinghouse has not yet rated CPP. As such, Arkansas will not be requesting reimbursement for this service until such a time as it becomes well-supported according to the federal clearinghouse or Arkansas is able to do an independent evaluation.

# Functional Family Therapy (FFT)

FFT is a trauma-informed evidence-based therapeutic intervention for at-risk families and juvenile justice involved youth. The FFT model is for families with children ages 10-18 to help develop better family relationships, learn to control anger and problem solve without fighting, improve positive communication skills, build trusting and respectful family relationships, and prevent involvement in the juvenile and legal system. FFT is currently rated as Well-Supported on the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse. DCFS has contracts across the state with multiple counseling agencies. Currently no therapists are trained in FFT, but several are interested in becoming FFT providers. All therapists providing FFT will be certified in FFT with Functional Family Therapy for Adolescent Behavioral Problems- Alexander, J. F., Waldron, H. B., Robbins, M. S., & Neeb, A. A. (2013). Functional Family Therapy for Adolescent Behavioral Problems. Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association. This is the manual used in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse review of FFT. Contracted therapists providing FFT must show proof of training and fidelity to the model which includes three phases: clinical training, supervisor training, and maintenance phase. The maintenance phase includes ongoing training and annual renewal. In addition to the requirements set by FFT, DCFS’ Assistant Director of Mental Health would provide contract oversight and CQI of providers through monthly reports and quarterly meetings to discuss issues and address barriers. Arkansas is not requesting reimbursement for this service at this time.

# At this time, DCFS is not able to provide an evaluation for each therapeutic intervention listed.

Therefore, while the work will begin in terms of teaching the Division’s front-line staff about these therapies, changing the PIs in the DCFS counseling contracts, and implementing the new provider monthly reports in January 2020; DCFS will not request claimibility on all of these services until such time as they are on the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse as well-supported or it becomes feasible for DCFS to conduct its own evaluation.

# c. Substance Abuse

DCFS is not currently requesting any substance abuse programs or treatment be a part of its Title IV-E Prevention Program Five-Year Plan. There are no approved substance abuse treatment models on the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse that are currently being used in Arkansas, nor does Arkansas have the resources at this time to do an independent evaluation of substance abuse treatment modalities. However, DCFS is looking at the following programs/services to explore for expansion of FFPSA implementation at a later date.

# Methadone Maintenance Therapy

Methadone Maintenance Therapy combines therapy with methadone medication for the treatment of opiate addiction. There are currently five Methadone Maintenance Clinics in Arkansas. The Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse has rated Methadone Maintenance Therapy as a promising practice. DCFS does not have the resources at this time to do an independent evaluation of clients in this treatment but will be exploring this as a possibility for expansion of FFPSA implementation.

# Arkansas Center for Addictions Research, Education, and Services (Arkansas Cares)

Arkansas Cares is a program of Methodist Family Health. It is a 3-month residential treatment program for parenting mothers with children 12 years old and younger. It is a dual diagnosis program that treats substance abuse and mental illness simultaneously. The family centered approach used is based on the Teaching Family Model. Additional services include parent training, vocational and educational training, children’s mental health services, early education services, and transitional housing. The program aims to decrease maternal substance abuse and promote healthy families. Arkansas Cares is currently rated as a promising practice on the CEBC. As the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse has not rated the program and DCFS does not currently have the ability to do an independent evaluation, DCFS is not requesting transitional payments for this service at this time. However, DCFS will be working with Methodist Family Health to explore how to partner to expand service availability and make this an official part of Family First in Arkansas.

# d. Cross Sectional

# Motivational Interviewing (MI)

Motivational interviewing is a client-centered method used to help increase clients’ intrinsic motivation to change. MI can be used by itself or in combination with other treatments. It is often used in pre-treatment work to help engage and motivate clients for other treatment modalities as it helps clients explore and resolve their ambivalence to change. MI is currently being reviewed by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse under substance abuse interventions; however, DCFS is encouraging the Children’s Bureau to take a broader look at MI as a beneficial piece in multiple disciplines. Such an expansion might then warrant all front-line child welfare staff being trained in MI. DCFS is exploring the costs associated with MI training, the logistics of training and coaching staff, and the feasibility of implementing an independent evaluation.

# Oversight and CQI

Oversight is provided by DCFS Program Management Staff and DHS contract management staff. DCFS uses monthly reports and a contract provider portal for monthly data analysis along with provider meetings and feedback loops between front line staff and providers. DCFS will implement semi-annual case reviews performed by the Program Management staff to oversee contract performance and ensure quality service delivery to children and families. Contract providers using evidence-based models are required to maintain fidelity of the model.

In addition to DCFS’ contracted evaluation, many of these services also have fidelity measures to which they must adhere in order to administer the program. SafeCare is a model that requires oversight and accreditation from the national SafeCare office. Intercept, and Family Centered Treatment (FCT) are the current models for Intensive In-Home in Arkansas. FCT requires licensure through the Family Centered Treatment Foundation which provides training, coaching, and certification to allow agencies to implement this model. Intercept was created by Youth Villages which has strong fidelity measures to ensure appropriate implementation. The proposed IFS service is HomeBuilders®. Homebuilders requires certification through the Institute for Family Development and has fidelity measures. Lastly, NFA is accredited through the Nurturing Parenting.

Specifically, in regard to FCT, in order for an agency to apply to provide the FCT model, they have to commit to ensure Family Centered Treatment Certification for all FCT clinicians, ensure FCT approved supervisor training for all FCT supervisors, sustainability of adherence of fidelity to the FCT model after implementation and certification, and provide a system to provide data collection to assure fidelity to the model. FCT requires licensure through the Family Centered Treatment Foundation which provides training, coaching, and certification to allow agencies to implement this model. As the providers of FCT are licensed by the Family Centered Treatment Foundation, there is already stringent monitoring of fidelity to the model. The DCFS In-Home Program Manager is in communication with the Family Centered Treatment Foundation consultant in charge of monitoring fidelity for St. Francis and will continue that for Youth Advocate Program.

DCFS is committed to providing continuous quality improvement and has included FCT and Intercept into the overall activities for the State’s CQI process and is amending the contract with Public Consulting Group (PCG), to include CQI of FCT and Intercept. PCG currently conducts Quality Service Peer Reviews for DCFS using the federal Onsite Review Instrument (OSRI) to continually assess the ability of DCFS to improve its case practice. The CQI team will expand to assess the extent to which the FCT and Intercept contracted providers are adhering to the model of the evidence-based program and that positive.

17 Current payment structure




outcomes in the areas of Safety, Permanency, and Well-Being are being achieved for families who are served.

For FCT, PCG will use a combination of case record reviews; interviews with parents/caregivers, DCFS staff, and providers; and a survey administered to program participants to inform the CQI reviews. These reviews aim to answer the following questions:

# Process Questions for FCT

1. To what degree were the Family Centered Evaluation tools used to adequately identify changes needed to improve family functioning?
2. To what degree was sufficient structure provided to families to guide them to complete tasks to meet their goals?
3. To what extent were families able to learn to recognize and value their improved behaviors?
4. To what extent do families have the capacity to handle crises independently of DCFS and other external parties?
5. To what extent are families satisfied with the support they received from the FCT provider?

# Outcome Questions for FCT

1. To what extent are children of participating families able to remain safely in their own homes?
2. To what extent do children have improved behavioral and emotional functioning?
3. To what extent have parenting practices improved?
4. To what extent has family functioning improved?

For Intercept, PCG will use the same combination of case record reviews; interviews with parents/caregivers, DCFS staff, and providers; and a survey administered to program participants to inform the CQI reviews. These reviews aim to answer the following questions:

# Process Questions for Intercept

1. To what degree was the Intercept clinical portal used to adequately identify changes needed to improve family functioning?
2. To what degree was sufficient structure provided to families to guide them to complete tasks to meet their goals?
3. To what extent were families able to learn to recognize and value their improved behaviors?
4. To what extent do families have the capacity to handle crises independently of DCFS and other external parties?
5. To what extent are families satisfied with the support they received from the FCT provider?

# Outcome Questions for Intercept

1. To what extent are children of participating families able to remain safely in their own homes?
2. To what extent do children have improved behavioral and emotional functioning?
3. To what extent have parenting practices improved?
4. To what extent has family functioning improved?

As described above, data collection shall include case record reviews, interviews, and surveys. The collection strategy for each is described below.

Case record reviews – For FCT, PCG will select a total of 50 cases annually, with 25 cases reviewed semi-annually. For Intercept, PCG will select a total of 50 cases annually, with 25 cases reviewed semi-annually. The semi-annual reviews will provide DCFs with the opportunity to make mid-course corrections.




If needed, the CQI team will create a structured case record review instrument, on each program, for reviewers to gather needed information to answer the research questions, minus the one which assesses client satisfaction, as that will be captured elsewhere.

St. Francis Ministries has implemented FCT in 15 counties, with an additional 13 counties to be served by Youth Advocate Program once trained. A stratified sample will be taken, selecting cases in proportion to those who began FCT within the last four to eight months prior to the start of the review month. This provides an opportunity to conduct a review of cases for families that have completed the program, providing the ability to assess all four phases of FCT, as well as an increased opportunity to meet with families in the interview phase of data collection, especially with those who are still active. Youth Villages has implemented Intercept in 9 counties. A stratified sample will be taken, selecting cases in proportion to those who began Intercept within the last 4 to eight months prior to the start of the review month. This again provides an opportunity to conduct a review of cases for families that have completed the program, as well as an increased opportunity to meet with families in the interview phase of data collection, especially those who are still actively receiving services.

# Interviews

As part of the case reviews, the CQI review team will conduct an interview with at least one parent or caregiver from each case, the case manager from the FCT provider or the case manager from Intercept who is or was assigned the case, and the DCFS family service worker. Attempts will be made to ask families who are no longer participating in the program to also participate in the interviews. A semi-structured interview protocol will be developed to encourage discussion with the respective parties and to learn about the successes and challenges the families, FSW, and FCT or Intercept provider, as applicable, encountered while receiving or providing support. This data collection strategy will be most helpful in shaping recommendations to improve the FCT and Intercept programs and likely other in-home service models as well.

# Surveys

A survey will be administered to all families as they exit the program, regardless if they completed FCT or Intercept successfully or not. The survey will consist of a series of yes/no, multiple choice, and Likert scale questions, and at least one open-ended question, in order to quantify the extent to which the FCT providers adhered to the four phases of the model or that the Intercept provider adhered to their protocol, from the perspective of the clients themselves. Results of the survey will also be used to gauge client satisfaction. The open-ended question(s) will allow respondents an opportunity to either explain their answer(s) or provide additional input. Based on the past experience of PCG, the providers will be asked to give the survey to families as they exit the program. The survey will include an online address which families can access to respond. Alternatively, families will be given an opportunity to return the completed survey in a postage paid return address envelope. These measures promote an increased response rate by allowing families to respond to PCG directly, promoting anonymity.

PCG will use both qualitative and quantitative analyses to inform the process and outcome components of the CQI review. As the CQI team carries out their onsite reviews of the sampled cases, the results will be posted to a secure online data collection instrument developed and hosted by PCG. Analysts will use a combination of SQL and R to measure frequencies and test for statistical significance. Comparisons will be drawn across the two providers and, where sufficient cases are sampled, across counties or at least across service areas. In future years, comparisons will also be drawn across review periods to measure practice improvement and to identify where practices or outcomes may be slipping. Quantitative data analysis will be used to inform the results of the surveys. Dependent on the rate of response, additional analysis will be done to identify the extent to which a family’s characteristics have an influence on their satisfaction of the program. The CQI team will conduct qualitative analysis of the interviews conducted with families, FSWs, and the FCT providers or Intercept providers, looking for common themes as well as.




differences. Qualitative analysis will also be conducted of the open-ended question(s) included within the survey to clients. Both the qualitative and quantitative analyses will look at FCT and Intercept separately. At the end of each semi-annual review, the CQI team will meet as a group to discuss emerging trends- both in terms of successes and challenges for participating families as well as the two provider and DCFS. This information, gathered and assimilated qualitatively, will also be used to inform the results of the CQI reviews and provide input into promising practices and shaping recommendations for improvement.

Within a month of completing the case reviews, PCG will provide DCFS with a draft report. The draft report will provide answers to each of the research questions, drawing comparisons over time, including across the two FCT providers, the Intercept provider, and Service Areas. Each report will also include a summary of the program’s strengths, areas of improvement, and recommendation for change. These reports will be discussed with Area Directors and supervisors at each areas QSPR Presentation and Discussion.

a. Defining Candidacy in Arkansas

The DCFS definition of candidacy took into consideration several factors that affect the Arkansas child welfare system including the legal definition of candidacy, who and how the Division already serves as clients, and prioritizing how to best serve DCFS clients. By taking all these factors into account, pulling data from CHRIS, and looking at known risk factors, the Division determined that the factors outlined in Table 5 below qualify a child as a foster care candidate in Arkansas. Only one factor has to be present for a child to be determined a candidate; however, multiple reasons may apply. Additional descriptions of each factor follow Table 5.

| 1) Garrett’s Law investigation that did not result in removal. \*All children in the home will be considered a candidate. | 2) A Protection Plan was put in place.                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3) A TDM was held that did not result in removal.                                                                         | 4) High or intensive risk assessment.                                            |
| 5) Risk of adoption or guardianship disruption.                                                                           | 6) SS case opened to prevent removal.                                            |
| 7) A less than custody has been filed.                                                                                    | 8) A 30-day petition has been filed.                                             |
| 9) Child is living with a relative caregiver (Does not include provisional or relative foster care).                      | 10) A CACD investigation with a true finding and an in-home or unknown offender. |
| 11) Reunification has occurred, and the case remains open.                                                                | 12) A sibling is in foster care.                                                 |
| 13) The parent or caregiver was in foster care as a child.                                                                | 14) Failure to Thrive.                                                           |

is a risk factor

# 1) Garrett’s Law (Front Door)

In SFY 2018, DCFS received 1,280 Garrett’s Law reports. Statewide, DCFS substantiated 92% of these referrals, opened a case on 94%19, and removed 15% at the time of the investigation. However, this rate fluctuates widely, and in some counties, they remove approximately half of all Garrett’s Law babies during the investigation. Furthermore, DCFS removes another 7% within 12 months, and in SFY 2018, 4% were cited in a subsequent true maltreatment report over the same time period. This equated to approximately 282 newborns removed from their home due to substance abuse, these figures only capture the newborn and no siblings that are also removed as a result of the drug use. Arkansas has chosen to include this population in its definition of candidacy, due to the vulnerable age of the child, the inconsistency with which DCFS handles these cases across areas, and the frequency with which they come into care or are subsequently abused.

# 2) Protection Plan in place (Front Door and Tertiary Prevention)

By definition, these children are at imminent risk of coming into care. Protection plans are only completed when a safety factor has been identified and the only options are a protection plan or bringing the child into care.

# 3) Team Decision Meetings (Front Door and Tertiary Prevention)

are only in 30 out of 75 counties at this time. In these counties they are held with every Garrett’s law and any time a protection plan is put in place. However, a pilot is being done in Area 8 with triggers for TDM that align to model fidelity. These TDMs are held when a worker is considering or has done a removal. When this goes statewide, the candidacy reason would read that a TDM was held that did not result in removal or the children were returned home. For more information regarding the statewide expansion of Considered Removal TDMs, please see Arkansas’s 2020-2024 Child and Family Services Plan Goal 2, Strategy 3.

# 4) High or Intensive Risk (Front Door and Secondary or Tertiary Prevention)

These families are at a greater danger of coming into care or experiencing subsequent maltreatment without intense intervention. In SFY 2018, 65% of children removed from the home had a current risk assessment of moderate, high, or intensive. There was missing data for approximately 15.5% of removals.20 A risk assessment will be completed at the time of determining candidacy. While subsequent risk assessments will be completed through the life of the case, candidacy status will not change due to a lower risk score. As the law states the risk should go down as services are being provided. At any point during a case if a child goes from a low-risk assessment to a high-risk assessment they will then be designated as a candidate.21

# 5) Failed Adoption/Guardianship

Due to restrictions of the CHRIS system, DCFS was unable to pull how many children came into care for this reason in SFY 2018; however, Arkansas plans to include this population within its definition of foster care candidates as allowed under Family First.22

19 This figure includes ps cases and fc cases.

20 The ones with missing data more than likely had their risk assessment entered after the removal screen was completed and therefore were not captured in the data request.

21 The state is not satisfied with our current risk assessment. We are currently working with NCCD to implement Structured Decision Making with fidelity. NCCD will be doing a risk analysis in the fall of 2019 and the new risk assessment should be in place by the end of 2020. Until that time, we will use our current risk assessment.

22 42 U.S.C. § 675(13)




# 6) In SFY 2018, 502 families were served through a supportive services case, and 3% of these children were taken into foster care. While this is a low number of overall DCFS cases and removals, it is important to capture this population because

- A. When judges open up a DCFS case to prevent removal, the children are at high risk of coming into care due to the court oversight component.
- B. While this data is not able to be pulled from CHRIS, there are cases opened because a caregiver is at a breaking point and voluntarily requests services. The caregiver normally does not want to give custody to DCFS but does also not know how to access the help they need. These children are certainly at imminent risk of coming into care, but if the child welfare system can help support the caregiver and provide services immediately, then the system may also be able to keep that child from coming into care and prevent maltreatment from ever occurring.
- C. DCFS wants to provide Family First services to families that become involved through a DR but need more intensive and longer involvement than a normal DR, which lasts between 30-60 days. As an example, families that had a DR and then a subsequent true maltreatment investigation that were then able to participate in NFA had the lowest number of subsequent maltreatment and removals. This group of families had the best outcomes from all waiver initiatives. DCFS suspects that providing them with NFA by opening a supportive services case to continue after the DR is closed will prevent removals and maltreatment from ever occurring.

# 7) Less than Custody Petitions

The current system does not have the capability of tracking how many less than custody petitions DCFS files in a year nor the outcomes of those. However, this subpopulation was included because the Division is restricting the rights of one or both parents, while saying that the child can safely remain in the home while services are provided. When there is a safety factor related to the parent, less than custody petitions also allow DCFS to leave a child in the home of a relative, if they have been in the relative’s home for six months.

# 8) 30-day Petitions

The current system does not have the capability of tracking how many 30-day petitions have been filed. However, these are filed when a child is at substantial risk of harm or removal without intervention and the Division feels the risk level is high enough to warrant court oversight.

# 9) Children living with a relative/caregiver

Of the 3,289 children that entered care in SFY 2018, 244 were removed from a relative caregiver and not a biological/legal/or stepparent. This category will overlap with the supportive services to prevent removal, but it will also capture those families that are using their informal support systems, allowing DCFS to provide services to both the current caregiver and the parent as needed.

# 10) CACD investigations with a true finding and in-home/unknown offender

CACD investigates Priority 1 investigations. These allegations are more severe (e.g., babies with broken bones, subdural hematomas, sexual abuse, etc.).

# 11) Reunification has occurred

The period immediately following reunification is a vulnerable time for families. In SFY 2018, 7.3% of children who were discharged to their families re-entered foster care within 12 months. However, in SFY 2017 and SFY 2016, those rates were 8.7% and 9.9%, respectively. Families deserve to have support during this transition, and DCFS needs to do everything it can to help reunification be successful. The DCFS Parent Advisory Council has also recommended that strategies be put in place to help after reunification. In addition, categorizing this as a candidacy reason will allow for some children to return home earlier than they traditionally could by opening up an avenue to provide intensive in-home services.

# 12) A sibling is in foster care

If there is a safety factor that caused the removal of one child, this indicates the remaining children may be at greater risk of coming into care.

13) The parent or caregiver was in foster care as a child - While this is not data that DCFS has traditionally tracked, a pull from SFY 2018 showed that approximately 8% of children who were removed had a parent who was in foster care at some point during their childhood.²³ This designation also allows the Division to continue serving youth that have left care at either 18 or 21 with a child.

14) Failure to Thrive (FTT) – Failure to thrive is a clinical term used by pediatric clinicians to describe infants and young children, generally three years of age and younger, who fail to grow as expected based on established growth standards for age and gender. FTT can trigger an array of health problems including long-term impairments in growth, physical and cognitive development, and other problems. While FTT can have organic causes, for the hotline to accept a report of FTT the reporter must have reason to believe that the child has FTT as a result of the parent’s or caretaker’s neglect. For a report to be determined true, the diagnosis of FTT must be verified by a physician and there must be a preponderance of evidence that the diagnosis is at least partially a result of the parent’s or caretaker’s failure to provide for the needs of the child.²⁴ Due to the serious potential outcomes and the vulnerability of this population, Arkansas has determined it appropriate to include in its definition of candidacy.

15) Medical Neglect for a child 5 and under – Arkansas defines medical neglect as a lack of medical or mental health treatment for a condition that could cause serious or long-term harm to the child if left untreated, this includes lack of follow through with a prescribed treatment plan. These allegations must be verified by a physician, nurse, psychologist, dentist, or by direct admission from the alleged offender. Due to the serious or long-term harm to the child and the vulnerability of this age group, DCFS has determined that this child will be a candidate.

16) Inadequate Supervision for a child 5 and under – Inadequate supervision is defined as a parent or caretaker failing to supervise a child resulting in the child being left alone or in an inappropriate circumstance that creates a dangerous situation that puts the child at risk of harm. For DCFS to find true for inadequate supervision there must be a preponderance of evidence that inadequate supervision occurred and that it was a result of the parent or caretaker’s neglect. Due to the vulnerability of children under the age of five, DCFS is including this in its definition of candidacy so that the Division can serve these children in their home and prevent removal or serious harm.

17) Domestic Violence is a risk factor – Under the Arkansas Child Maltreatment Act, Domestic Violence is not listed as child abuse. However, the link between domestic violence and child abuse is strong and is a complicating factor for families served by DCFS. DCFS recognized that workers need more support in assessing for domestic violence and working with families where DV has occurred. DCFS is working on ways to increase workers knowledge of DV and increase appropriate services for this population.

# b. Identifying and Reassessing Candidacy

FFSPA requires a prevention plan to be created for every child who is determined to be a candidate. The state is eligible for reimbursement for up to 12 months after a child is identified as a candidate in a prevention plan.²⁵

DCFS created a FFPSA eligibility screen to ensure workers are correctly identifying children who are FFPSA eligible. This screen can be completed in an investigation or in a case and will be done on each child in the home ages 0 through 17. This screen will be mandatory in all investigations that end with opening a new case, reopening a closed case, or connecting to a new case. Once a child is designated as a candidate, they remain a candidate for the length of the case, until 12 months has passed, or until

23 This information is limited in that data was only able to be pulled from Arkansas’ DCFS and information is only reliable from approximately 2001 to current.

24 Arkansas Child Maltreatment Act

25 42 U.S.C. § 671(e)(3)

The last day of the month in which the child turns 18. Therefore, this screen is only mandated to be completed once, but if a client is identified as a candidate and the case remains open past twelve months then candidacy will be end-dated, and the worker will receive an alert to complete this screen again, if necessary. While it is only mandatory at these times, a case worker may go in at any point during a case to complete this screen should changed circumstances then qualify a child as a foster care candidate. For example, this may occur when a child has been in foster care and returns home and a case remains open. Another example might be if three months into a case a protection plan must be put in place. This screen will also capture if a youth is FFPSA eligible due to being a youth in foster care who is pregnant or parenting, which adults in the family are eligible because they are a parent or caregiver of a candidate, and where a youth was residing at the time they were identified as a candidate.26

# c. Connecting Candidacy to Appropriate EBP

Once FFPSA eligibility (either through candidacy or as a pregnant or parenting foster youth) is established, a Prevention Plan will be accessible to complete in CHRIS.27 While eligibility is determined separately and must be completed on each child, the Prevention Plan will be a family plan that only identifies those children and parents or caregivers who are eligible. While a small timeframe is allowable between identifying someone as eligible and completing the Prevention Plan screen, once the first prevention plan is completed, it will auto-populate a creation date of the date eligibility was approved.28

The worker will be able to choose each client that is FFSPA eligible and pick a FFSPA-eligible service. At the appropriate time, the worker will put the begin date, the end-date, and whether or not the service was successfully completed. There is also a mandatory text box for the worker to state why this particular intervention was chosen and any pertinent notes. For pregnant and parenting foster youth, the worker will choose a service that will help ensure the youth is prepared or able to parent and describe in the narrative section the foster care prevention strategy for any child born to the youth. This screen can be updated at any time but will be mandatory to update with the case plan, every three months.

As discussed in section c of the Forward, Arkansas is aware that there will be eligible clients where no appropriate FFSPA eligible service is available, either because none of the FFSPA services in the plan are available in that county, or because none of the identified services are appropriate to meet the needs of the family at that time. There is a box on the prevention plan screen for a worker to check that states, “No Family First Eligible Services at this time.” The text box will still be mandatory.

This prevention plan will print along with the case plan that address all other services. Workers will not be expected to duplicate services from the prevention plan into the case plan, but rather the services in the prevention plan and the case plan should work in tandem. By allowing prevention plans to be completed on all FFSPA eligible clients even when a FFSPA service is not available, it will allow DCFS to identify what populations are underserved by the Division and where to focus attention when looking for new services or expanding services into other areas.

In addition to candidacy, most of the FFSPA services have specific eligibility requirements. These requirements are detailed in section II Title IV-E Prevention Services. DCFS staff will be trained through in-person and on-line trainings on FFSPA services and eligibility requirements as described in sections VII and VIII of this plan. By the end of the second year of FFSPA implementation, DCFS will have a flow.

26 See Appendix B for a mockup of the current screen. Details may change prior to Oct. 1, 2019.

27 See Appendix B for a mockup of the current screen. Details may change prior to Oct. 1, 2019.

28 This is because the ACT states eligibility for reimbursement starts the day a client is determined to be a candidate in a prevention plan, even though the date someone is identified and the date a prevention plan is created may not be the same date.

chart available to help workers and supervisors ask the appropriate questions when looking for FFSPA eligible services. This flow chart, which will be updated as new services become available, will be developed from the established program eligibility guidelines, information gathered from the evaluation, and from input from providers across the FFSPA services spectrum.

d. Reassessing Candidacy Definition Through Life of Family First

DCFS recognizes that the child welfare system is constantly changing and evolving. With that in mind, it is reasonable to expect that the current definition of candidacy is not set in stone, but rather should evolve along with the needs of DCFS and the families it serves. Throughout the first five years of implementation, DCFS will actively seek feedback from partners, providers, and parents, while also analyzing data to make changes to candidacy as needed.

# IV. Monitoring Child Safety and Risk

Pre-Print Section 3

DCFS policy requires FSWs to assess and address risk and safety concerns for all children receiving services. As part of the root cause analysis completed for the CFSR, it was determined that assessing and addressing risk and safety concerns continues to be an area where Arkansas struggles. Round 3 of the CFSR found that lack of ongoing risk assessments is a greater problem in in-home cases than in foster care; however, steady improvements have been made in SFY 2018 and the first half of SFY2019. Improvements can be attributed to additional staff positions, strategies to decrease staff turnover, and a focus on prevention work.

Arkansas’s current risk assessment tool was adapted from SDM and is a double-stream abuse/neglect assessment. This risk assessment tool must be used in an investigation with a true finding. Current DCFS policy reflects that the risk assessment should be used to inform case opening, however, since unsubstantiated investigations do not require a risk assessment be completed, in practice this does not factor into case opening decisions. Cases are currently opened based on either a true finding or a safety factor. Unsubstantiated investigations do not result in a case opening even in families where there is substantial risk for future maltreatment without intervention unless the family voluntarily requests services.

In addition, DCFS currently has one risk assessment tool to be used at all stages of involvement with the family. Arkansas is actively addressing this in its work with NCCD.

Efforts are in place to improve training, support, and the tools used for assessing risk and safety. For example, DCFS requested assistance from Casey Family Programs and the NCCD Children’s Research Center (CRC) to help in assessing and remedying potential obstacles to effectively assessing and addressing risk and safety. Work began in 2018, with CRC initially focusing on understanding existing practice and tools through two primary activities: an offsite review of policy and key informant interviews.

DCFS is using implementation science to implement Safety Organized Practice and Structured Decision Making over a five-year period (see Arkansas’s Child and Family Services Review Program Improvement Plan – still pending approval – and 2020-2024 Child and Family Services Plan – also still pending approval – for more details regarding the work with NCCD. Further information regarding the implementation process is in section VIII Child Welfare Workforce Training.

NCCD (CRC) is working with DCFS to create validated assessment tools that are specific to stages of a case. These include an intake assessment, safety assessment, risk assessment, case planning tool, reunification assessment, and risk reassessment as follows:

pg. 28




# 1) Intake assessment

This assessment has two components: screening and response priority. These components are used to help the hotline worker determine if a CPS response is needed, based on local legal and regulatory requirements, and if they should be a Priority 1, Priority 2, or D.R. assignment. At this time, CACD is in agreement with implementing this tool.

# 2) Safety assessment

This assessment provides a structure for assessing the presence of immediate danger to a child. Workers will use this guide as a support in making decisions about whether a child may remain in the home with no intervention, may remain in the home with a protection plan in place, or must be taken into protective custody. Use of this tool will help to provide consistency in decision making across the state. This tool is to be documented with 24 hours of first contact with the victim or identified children, when there is a change in family conditions, if there is a change in the initial safety decision, and when a recommendation is made to close an in-home case.

# 3) Risk assessment

This is an actuarial assessment that looks at a range of family characteristics including number of prior referrals, children’s ages, and caregiver behaviors that demonstrate a strong correlation with subsequent child abuse and neglect referrals to classify families by their likelihood of future involvement with the system. This risk assessment classifies families in low, moderate, high, and intensive risk levels. Workers will use this guide as a support in making decisions about case opening and intensity of services.

# 4) Case planning tool

This was formerly known as the family strengths and needs assessment. This tool provides a reference to ensure that all workers consider each family’s strengths and needs in a clear, consistent manner and helps identify priority areas to address in the case plan.

# 5) Reunification assessment

This tool is used when at least one child is in out-of-home care. This tool helps ensure that local and federal policy regarding reunification, permanency planning, and termination of parental rights are effectively translated into practice. The presumptive guidelines behind this tool are based on risk of future maltreatment, demonstrated parenting interest and involvement in their children’s lives, and safety of the home environment.

# 6) Risk reassessment

This tool is used for in-home cases and is used at regular intervals (i.e., every 90 days). This tool helps guide a worker in making decisions regarding whether a case should remain open; and if so, at what level or intensity of services.

Due to the transition to a CCWIS system taking several years, CRC is hosting these tools in their data collection system. The current plan is that as the CCWIS system is being built they will be integrated into this new system. These tools will help improve consistency and accuracy in assessing and addressing risk and safety. These tools will be implemented in phases as each tool is customized for Arkansas based on state laws and preferred language. Each tool will be tested for inter-rater reliability. The intake assessment will be the first tool to be implemented in early 2020. In the meantime, DCFS will continue using the current Health and Safety Assessment which is comprised of three parts: The Health and Safety Checklist, Safety Planning, and Risk Assessment.

The Health and Safety Checklist is comprised of 14 safety factors to help the worker determine if a child’s health or safety are in immediate danger. The initial Health and Safety Checklist is completed by the DCFS investigator. If the investigation is being conducted by CACD and they identify a safety factor, they request a safety assessment from DCFS. Safety Planning is completed if DCFS identifies a safety factor. Safety planning may include the development of protection plan with the family to mitigate the identified safety factor and enhance the caregiver’s protective capacity or removal of the child from the home. The protection plan is monitored by the investigator for the duration of the investigation and must be formally reassessed at 30 days. If substantial risk of harm to the child’s health and safety remains at the 30-day reassessment, then DCFS will file a petition of dependency/neglect. Protection plans can be amended as necessary.

As referenced above, if a suitable protection plan cannot be made, then the DCFS Family Service Worker (FSW) will take a 72 hour hold and petition the court for emergency custody. The identified safety factor




and the protection plan or 72-hour hold is documented in CHRIS under the Health and Safety Checklist and Safety Planning screens. When a safety factor is not identified it is also documented on the Health and Safety Checklist and the Safety Planning screen is not completed. DCFS assesses for safety during every interaction with the family. If a safety factor is identified at any point during a case these same steps are to occur.

The third component of the Health and Safety Assessment is the risk assessment. The DCFS FSW completes the first risk assessment which establishes a baseline level of risk for the family.

The current risk assessment is a double-stream abuse/neglect assessment that identifies factors such as previous investigations, the presence of domestic abuse, substance abuse issues, etc. that indicate the child may be at risk of future abuse or neglect. The levels of risk are classified as low, moderate, high, and intensive. Supervisors may override and choose a higher risk level in cases where there is non-accidental physical injury to an infant, death (previous or current) of a sibling as a result of abuse or neglect, serious non-accidental physical injury requiring hospital or medical treatment, and in sexual abuse cases where the perpetrator is likely to have access to the child victim. The level of risk indicates the level of involvement to assure the child’s well-being and is used to help inform the case plan in the subsequent case. DCFS assesses for risk during every interaction with the family, but the first formal risk assessment must be documented within thirty days of the receipt of the investigation and approved by the supervisor within forty-five days. This is completed prior to the opening of the supportive or protective services case. Families with a risk-assessment level of high or intensive must be seen on at least a weekly basis. The risk assessment is updated throughout the life of the case as circumstances change.

In addition, current policy requires the FSW to make face to face home visits weekly for the first thirty days. These visits can move to biweekly or monthly with a waiver after the first month only if the risk assessment reflects a low to moderate risk. High and intensive risk levels require weekly face to face visits. During these visits, the FSW is to talk privately with each child and caregiver, as well as observe the home and family interaction. In addition to the formal assessments, FSWs are to informally assess for risk and safety during each interaction with a family. With implementation of SDM and SOP, policy will be aligned to ensure required visits match the level and intensity of service recommended by the SDM tools.

DCFS is currently using the FAST as its assessment/case planning tool for in-home cases. Per policy the FAST is updated every three months at which time the case plan is also updated. As the prevention plan is an addendum to the case plan it will also be updated at this time. This provides for a reexamination of the prevention plan and whether or not the risk of the child entering care remains high despite the provision of services or programs. These frequent updates allow for the worker and family to assess if the current services are still appropriate, if additional supports should be put in place to help the family succeed, or if an altogether new strategy is needed. Should DCFS switch tools in the future, they will still be updated every three months per policy.

The Health and Safety Assessment, FAST, Prevention Plan, and Case Plan are all responsibilities of the DCFS FSW and is informed by the family, the family’s support system, service providers, and other involved parties. DCFS closes non-court involved cases when both the FSW and the family agree that services are no longer needed and there is low risk of future maltreatment or that the needs of the family are best met by one or more referrals to other service providers outside of DCFS contracted services.

# V. Evaluation Strategy and Waiver Request

Pre-Print Section 2

The Family First Services and Prevention Act requires that each program listed in a State’s Five-Year Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan have a well-designed and rigorous evaluation strategy, unless




granted a waiver from HHS. HHS may waive this requirement if they deem the evidence of the effectiveness of the practice to be profound and the state to meet the continuous quality improvement standard regarding the practice.29 DCFS is not requesting a waiver for any services at this time.

# Theory of Change

DCFS’ theory of change asserts that families who are struggling with mental health conditions, substance abuse, the lack of parenting skills and problematic family dynamics due to deficits in the five protective factors (Nurturing and Attachment, Knowledge of Parenting and Child Development, Parental Resilience, Social Connections, Concrete Support, and Social and Emotional Competence of Children)30 are at greater risk for child abuse and neglect and are at greater risk of their children being brought into care. Therefore, if DCFS provides families whose children are at risk of being brought into foster care with services that address these core issues then family functioning will improve, less children will enter foster care, and children can remain safely in their home. While DCFS has services that address mental health and substance abuse issues the first phase of Family First implementation really focuses on parenting skills and the protective factors.

- Reduced overall foster care population

# Long-Term Outcomes




# Evaluation

DCFS has contracted with an independent evaluator, The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS), to conduct a well-designed and rigorous outcomes evaluation of all programs listed under its initial In-Home Parenting strategies. This includes SafeCare, each Intensive In-Home Services (IIHS) program, Intensive Family Services (IFS - although, IFS will not be included in the evaluation until SFY2021. The major objectives of this evaluation are to determine if each service is successful in reducing the removal of children into foster care, reducing maltreatment and subsequent maltreatment, and reducing future involvement with the child welfare system with the overall goals of improving child safety, permanency, and well-being. As implementation expands more programs will be added to the evaluation strategy either through an amendment to the current contract or through an additional procurement process.

As outlined above, DCFS will use the outcomes evaluation, conducted by UAMS, and the results from the CQI process, conducted by PCG to examine all of its in-home parenting interventions collectively to help guide decisions about implementation, expansion, and monitoring outcomes. Special focus will be given to Family Centered Treatment (FCT) as it is the main prevention program for which DCFS is requesting Family First claiming.

# Evaluation Plan for Family Centered Treatment and Intercept

# Program Description:

Family Centered Treatment: As detailed in the California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare (CEBC)31, FCT is a strengths-based, trauma informed, and evidence-based family preservation model that provides services to families directly in their homes. FCT is designed for families faced with disruption or dissolution of their family. FCT targets families with members at imminent risk of placement into (or needing intensive services to return from) treatment facilities, foster care, group or residential treatment, psychiatric hospitals, or juvenile justice facilities. As such it provides services to children/adolescents who have one or more of the following: adjustment disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder, depression, mood disorder, bipolar, disruptive behavior, abusive and neglectful family situations, exposure to violence and domestic violence, and involvement in juvenile crime. It also provides services to the parents/caregivers of these children and parents who experience domestic violence and/or substance abuse.

FCT has six main goals and treatment services typically last 4-6 months:

1. Enable family stability via preservation of or development of a family placement
2. Enable the necessary changes in the critical areas of family functioning that are the underlying causes for the risk of family dissolution.
3. Bring a reduction in hurtful and harmful behaviors affecting family functioning.
4. Develop an emotional and functioning balance in the family so that the family system can cope effectively with any individual member’s intrinsic or unresolvable challenges.
5. Enable changes in referred client behavior to include family system involvement so that changes are not dependent upon the therapist.
6. Enable discovery and effective use of the intrinsic strengths necessary for sustaining the changes made and enabling stability.

# Youth Villages’ Intercept

Intercept, developed by Youth Villages, is an intensive in-home parenting skills program used to safely prevent children from entering foster care or to reunify them as quickly as safely possible if foster care is necessary. Intercept is appropriate for children ranging in age from birth to 18, with services lasting four to nine months (typically, four to six months for prevention or six to nine months for reunification). Intercept works with all members of the family to address all issues impacting stability. Services are provided in the home or community depending on the needs of the family. The family also has 24-hour on-call crisis support from the provider. Intercept is trauma-informed, and the caseload are small with only 4-5 families per worker. The Family Intervention Specialist (FIS) provides evidence-based and research-informed interventions. Following a detailed case conceptualization process, developed by Youth Villages, specialists collaborate with other providers, schools, case workers, courts, and other community supports to formulate individualized treatment plans, which are reviewed bi-weekly with licensed clinicians, assuring fidelity with the program model. The FIS receives extensive, ongoing training from the licensed clinicians to continually improve their skills. Ongoing assessments and reviews are used to measure each family's progress. This comprehensive treatment approach also includes helping the family access community resources, ongoing long-term support, and in general increasing a family’s social support network.

# Evaluation Questions

# Family Centered Treatment

UAMS will conduct a rigorous quantitative outcomes evaluation using a quasi-experimental design. The research questions specific to FCT will be:

# Child Safety Outcomes

1. Will families served by FCT have reduced entry into foster at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months following completion of the intervention as compared to a propensity matched comparison sample?
2. Will families served by FCT have reduced entry into foster care during the treatment period for FCT and propensity matched non-FCT families? The sample for this research question will include families who were not involved with FCT as a reunification case.
3. Will families served by FCT have reduced true findings and/or open cases after program closure at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months following completion of the intervention as compared to a propensity-matched comparison sample?

# Permanency Outcomes

Will families served by FCT have increased permanency at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months following completion of the intervention as compared to a propensity-matched comparison sample? The sample for this research question will include families who were involved with FCT as a reunification case to see if FCT families were more likely to be reunified than propensity matched non-FCT families.

# Well-Being Outcomes

Will families served by FCT have increased family functioning from entry into to exit from protective services as compared to a propensity-matched comparison sample?
Will families served by FCT have increased well-being from entry into to exit from foster care compared to a propensity-matched comparison sample of children who were reunified with their family? The sample for this research question will include families who were involved with FCT as

# Outcomes Measures for FCT and Intercept®

Extracts of quantitative case data from CHRIS, DCFS’ case management system, will be used to measure all outcomes in the evaluation of FCT and Intercept. CHRIS extracts will be generated semi-annually. CHRIS data include family and child characteristics and FFPSA candidacy definitions. CHRIS data also includes case outcomes and dates of relevant case outcomes. The specific dates which will be used in the evaluation include the date of a true finding, and dates of reunification and/or subsequent removal. Family Service Workers also enter intervention information into CHRIS including the date of referral for FCT or Intercept and other in-home parenting interventions (used to identify an appropriate comparison condition), date of program inception and completion, and whether the family was successful.


in meeting program goals. The dates of program referral, start, completion, and successful completion of program goals will be verified with billing data which is closely monitored for accuracy.

The Family Advocacy and Support Tool (FAST) assessments are designed for use with the entire family. AR uses the FAST tool within 30 days of protective services case initiation and completes the tool every 3 months. The Arkansas FAST includes multiple indicators of family functioning, including collaboration and supportive relationships among family members, communication and role appropriateness, family conflict and safety, financial resources, housing condition, and residential stability. In addition to general family functioning, the Arkansas FAST includes multiple indicators of the child’s status, including relationships with caregiver and others, health status, mental health status and adjustment to trauma, cognitive skills and educational status, and self-regulation and interpersonal skills. Items identified as a ‘0’ are often strengths that can be used in strength-based planning. Items rated a ‘1’ should be monitored and preventive efforts might be indicated. Items rated a ‘2’ or ‘3’ are actionable and should be addressed in the intervention plan.

The Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) assessments are used in Arkansas with youth in out of home placements, with two unique tools created to assess the strengths and needs of children and youth, one for those ages 0–4 and a second for those five years of age and older.

The general method of analysis for determining the success of FCT and Intercept on outcomes of interest will be a prospective cohort analysis. Each case is measured from a defined starting point that is relevant to the outcomes being analyzed, for example, referral of a case to the intervention. From this point in time, prospective data were analyzed to determine whether the outcome occurred within specified time frames as described in the research questions above.

# Statistical techniques and quasi-experimental methods for FCT and Intercept

In addition to descriptive and bivariate analyses, the evaluators will make use of a variety of non-experimental analytic techniques to measure the impact of each of these services. As in most applied policy research, researchers are generally unable to randomly assign some populations to receive the policy interventions and others to a control group. In the absence of experimental methods, we look to quasi-experimental methods.

Propensity matched analyses will be used to examine each of the outcomes noted above for each of the interventions. To reduce selection bias, intervention children will be matched with non-intervention children based on 1:1 propensity matching, as follows. First, a logistic regression model will be fitted to estimate the probability of a child being assigned to the intervention using the child’s demographics, mother’s demographics, parent and family characteristics used to determine candidacy, and geographic and socioeconomic indicators. These independent variables specifically included the child’s gender and age, the mother’s race/ethnicity, the number of children in the household, candidacy reasons, and past history or open protective services support, and two indicators based on the family ZIP-code, the rural-urban commuting area code (RUCA) and the ZIP-code-level median household income. Median household income quartiles will be derived from assigning the family address a median household income based on the ZIP-code in which they resided at the time of referral.

A greedy matching algorithm will then be used to match FCT or Intercept children (cases) and non-intervention children (controls) based on a 1:1 match of those with identical or near identical model-derived propensity to be in each of the intervention groups. The SAS procedure proc psmatch will be used to perform both the estimation of propensity score and matching. Exact match may be made on some key characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity, candidacy, and RUCA) if it leads to an improvement of




Overall balance across covariates. All statistical analyses will be performed using the SAS system for Windows.

To test the association of FCT or Intercept enrollment and outcomes, UAMS will fit outcome-specific generalized linear models using the SAS proc glimmix procedure. Matched pairs identified for each of the interventions will be accounted for in individual generalized linear models by using random variable indicator for the matched-pairs dyad. An intent-to-treat design will be used to test differences in outcomes. If sample sizes are sufficient, additional sensitivity analysis may be conducted to subsample participants who successfully completed each of the interventions. FCT and Intercept service delivery report data, including dosage/completion data, will be drawn from child/family-level service delivery report data that contracted providers are required to produce and submit to DCFS. Where sufficient service delivery data exists, the preferred method for coding of service delivery data will be as an ordered or continuous variable, specifying dosage from zero to full completion of the intervention. In this way, evaluators will be able to determine the extent to which partial completion of an intervention may impact the intended outcome, as well as allowing for within-group comparisons.

# Sample

# Family Centered Treatment

As described, FCT will be provided by two contractors for services in a total of 28 counties. St. Francis ministries has implemented FCT in 15 counties in the Northern and Eastern parts of Arkansas. Youth Advocate Programs (YAP) will be implementing FCT in an additional 13 counties in the Northern and Southern parts of Arkansas.

Eligible families are those with children aged 0-18. Referrals to FCT are provided from DCFS based on candidacy guidelines. The most common candidacy reasons for referral will include items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, and 17 as outlined in Table 5. The two providers, St. Francis and YAP, will serve approximately 350 families (or an estimated 840 children32) annually. St. Francis and YAP are contracted to serve 121 and 130 families per year, respectively.

# Intercept

As described, Intercept will be provided by one contractor for services in a total of 9 counties in the North Central and Eastern parts of Arkansas.

Eligible families are those with children aged 0-18. Referrals to Intercept are provided from DCFS based on candidacy guidelines, with the most common candidacy reasons including 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, and 17 as outlined in Table 5. The provider will serve approximately 180 families annually.

According to the DCFS Annual Report Card for SFY 201933, there were 5,054 families (12,320 children) in protective services and another 652 families in supportive services. Of the children who began receiving in-home protective services cases one year prior to SFY 2019, six percent experienced a true report of maltreatment within one year. Children ages zero to five made up nearly half (48%) of children involved in in-home protective services cases at the end of SFY 2019.

# Power Analysis

UAMS performed a calculation to determine the power to correctly reject the null hypothesis, given sample sizes and minimum effect of differences between each of the interventions, FCT or Intercept, and non-intervention populations (control) to conclude success of each of the interventions. UAMS chose to determine power based on reported effects of each intervention. UAMS computed a priori power.




# Family Centered Treatment

To obtain the expected effect sizes, UAMS used data reported for FCT in the state of Indiana in which there was a significant difference in family dissolution, with families in FCT significantly more likely to remain intact than non-FCT families (55.61% vs. 39.04%; d=.34). They also opted to determine the necessary sample to detect a smaller difference in which families in FCT were less likely to repeat true findings at 6 months post-intervention than non-FCT families (1.68% vs. 4.35%; d=.16), which was not significant.

Based on chi-square test analysis, power estimate of at least 0.80, and alpha level of .05, the total sample would have to be 141 to detect the larger effect (d=.36) and 635 to detect the smaller effect (d=.16). Computing sensitivity using the same assumptions (power=0.80, alpha=.05), our estimated sample of 700 could detect an effect size d=.15. UAMS also computed the effect size for a smaller sample (250 matched pairs), a total sample of 500 could detect an effect size d=.18. Therefore, even if the sample is smaller than anticipated, we should be able to detect effects that are small to moderate in size.

# Intercept®

To obtain the expected effect sizes, UAMS used data reported for Intercept® in the state of Tennessee in which families in Intercept were significantly more likely to remain intact than propensity-matched comparison families (OR=.47; d=.26). Findings were also of similar magnitude when examining whether families in Intercept were less likely to be removed from the home at 12 months post-intervention than propensity-matched comparison families (OR=.40; d=.22).

Based on chi-square test analysis, power estimate of at least 0.80, and alpha level of .05, the total sample would have to be 128, with 64 families in each sample, to detect the larger effect (OR=.40) and 178, with 89 families in each sample, to detect the smaller effect (OR=.47). Computing sensitivity using the same assumptions (power=0.80, alpha=.05), our estimated sample of 180 could detect an odds ratio of 0.59 (d=.33). UAMS also computed the effect size for a smaller sample, 125 matched pairs resulting in a total sample of 250, could detect an odds ratio of 0.53 (d=.29). Therefore, even if the sample is smaller than anticipated, we should be able to detect effects that are moderate in size.

# Challenges and Limitations

There are limitations to the proposed evaluation. The sole reliance on administrative data for outcomes of the current study is one limitation. There are some mechanisms in place at the state level to ensure the correctness and completeness of data. Area supervisors review candidacy with family service workers to ensure the correct candidacy reasons are included in the case files. There is also a nightly verification of social security numbers (SSN) of individuals with open cases, which can be used to correct the SSNs within the file and to ensure unduplicated case numbers for analysis. That said, there are limited resources to conduct data cleaning of individual data elements. As such, there will likely be some data loss due to out of date or range values. The UAMS evaluation team will work with DCFS to correct data elements obtained during the semi-annual data extraction. For example, there are opportunities to identify out of range dates, such as those that occur in the distant past or the future, which will be done to maximize data correctness. It is also possible that enhancements to CHRIS may be required to facilitate documentation. In this case, this may result in a lack of available data and a backlog of information that would require retroactive data entry.

# Evaluation Team

The FAST tool provides opportunities to document changes within families; however, the assessment windows on which Arkansas administers the tool are not directly tied to additional interventions. The FAST is conducted within 30 days of protective services case initiation and completes the tool again every 3 months. Therefore, the use of this tool does not necessarily reflect the beginning and end of FCT or Intercept services, but rather more closely replicates the beginning and end of protective services.

An additional limitation is inherent in the quasi-experimental design. Randomization is the best method for concluding causation. While propensity matching has strengths for application in child welfare settings, it is possible that unmeasured confounding variables may be present, which would lead to biased results. Another limitation of our proposed analytic plan may be our ability to identify a fully matched comparison population for either intervention. It is unclear from the sampling whether a matched comparison group within the counties where FCT or Intercept are available.

While FCT will not be available in the quantity to serve any eligible family, there are additional services available within the counties served, including other evidence-based programs. Similarly, Intercept is available in 9 counties, but other services are also available. If it is not possible to identify a comparison group for FCT within the 28 counties in which FCT is available or for Intercept within the 9 counties where it is available, we will propensity match for a control group within the state, matching on the characteristics described above and on ZIP-code computed RUCA and income to identify a matched sample of families where each respective intervention was not available within the state. Further, power analysis are based on the full sample of families for whom intervention services are expected, analyses for subsamples appear sufficiently powered to demonstrate a small effect for FCT and a moderate effect for Intercept in the intent to treat design, but large attrition from either intervention may create samples for research question 2 or 3 that are underpowered.

The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) is contracted to develop and implement the evaluation. All personnel are employed by UAMS in the College of Medicine’s Department of Family and Preventive Medicine (DFPM), Research and Evaluation Division. Dr. Lorraine McKelvey, Associate Professor, leads the evaluation team. Dr. McKelvey earned her doctoral degree in Developmental Psychology specializing in Applied Developmental Science from Michigan State University. Dr. McKelvey has home visiting research for nearly two decades. She was a member of the research consortium of the national Early Head Start Research Project; a co-investigator of the Pew Charitable Trusts’ HV Campaign project that examined the elements of home-based EHS services most related to improved child outcomes: and conducted research of a home visiting program for teen parents using the Healthy Families America (HFA) model. Dr. McKelvey is the lead evaluator for the Arkansas’ Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting programs (HFA, Parents as Teachers, Home Instruction for the Parents of Preschool Youngsters, and Following Baby Back Home) and SafeCare.

See Table 6 for which services will be formally evaluated, for which DCFS is considering requesting waivers for in the future, and which services DCFS will claim FFPSA funding. Information in Table 6 assumes waiver approval for transitional payments until rated on the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse and assumes implementation of service occurs on schedule. Adjustments will be made accordingly.

DCFS is committed to continuous quality improvement through contract monitoring, evaluation, and CQI. Each contract is overseen by a program manager or an Assistant Director. SafeCare, Intensive In-Home Services (IIHS), and IFS are all monitored by the In-Home Program Manager. Through initial implementation of Intensive In-Home Services, monthly meetings with the providers are held to discuss implementation barriers and successes. Feedback from field staff is incorporated into these monthly meetings. Providers must also submit a certification of compliance each month along with a monthly report. The information provided in the monthly report is changed as needed to ensure the right information is being reported. Along with the monthly reports, each IIHS provider must submit semiannual and annual reports on the outcomes they are achieving. Regular provider meetings are also held with SafeCare, and IFS; SafeCare is every other month, and IFS is every quarter. All counseling contracts are monitored by the DCFS Assistant Director of Mental Health. The DCFS substance abuse contracts are




# VI. Prevention Caseloads

DCFS does not have a set ratio of cases by type for frontline case workers. Arkansas is a very rural state, with 42% of its population residing in a rural county; this is a stark comparison to the national profile of only 15% of the population living in a rural area. In rural counties, there is a limited number of staff because positions are assigned based on the need (i.e., number of cases in a county). Due to these dynamics, the structure of each DCFS office varies by county. Some county offices have FSWs that work investigations, foster care, and in-home cases, where others have designated investigation units and units with mixed caseloads of foster care and in-home, while others still, have designated staff for each role.

DCFS’ current goal is to maintain caseloads at 20 or under. In SFY2018, the statewide average has ranged from a low of 18.7 in June 2019 to a high of 23.4 in Oct. 2018. For the past two years, statewide average caseloads have peaked in October with somewhat steady decreases until a low during June, July, and August. While caseload averages are slightly skewed by graduated caseloads, and some areas struggle with caseload sizes much more (e.g., within SFY2018, Area 1 had an average high of 39 and an average low of 25.2, whereas Area 10 had a high of 17.3 and a low of 15), DCFS has still made great strides in lowering caseload sizes in the last three years. In 2016, the average statewide caseload was 28, with six counties averaging caseloads above 40 and three above 50. As of June 2019, the statewide average was 18.7, no county had an average caseload size above 40, and 80% of the state had average caseloads 25 and below.

Caseloads are monitored at the unit, county, area, and statewide level through reports generated from NCCD. In addition, the Community Services Unit monitors to ensure graduated case load guidelines are being followed.37

DCFS has also partnered with NCCD (CRC) to implement SafeMeasures (see Arkansas’s 2020-2024 Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP) Goal 4, Strategy 10). While SafeMeasures is a case management tool helping workers manage their workflow, it also allows real time data from the worker level to the statewide level. SafeMeasures allows supervisors and county supervisors to more easily monitor caseload sizes on a day to day basis.

Over the last three years, DCFS has implemented strategies to address caseload size and retention, and while great strides have been made, DCFS recognized that a more holistic approach was needed to help the agency achieve its goals in a sustainable manner. As part of this effort, DCFS applied for and received a grant from the National Child Welfare Workforce Institute (NCWWI) to be a NCWWI Workforce Excellence site in partnership with the University of Arkansas (UA) at Little Rock School of Social Work (see Arkansas 2020-2024 CFSP Goal 4, Strategy 11). In addition, DCFS is exploring using SDM risk assessments to weight PS and SS cases to help supervisors make better decisions when assigning cases and to elevate the importance of in-home cases.

Along with monitoring DCFS caseloads, contracts with DCFS In-Home Parenting EBPs include limitations on case load sizes. SafeCare staff have a full caseload at 12 families and can have no more than 15.

37 DCFS implemented graduated caseloads in 2017 to ensure that new workers were assigned cases in a structured manner.




(note that for SafeCare each caregiver in the home is counted as a separate case to align with the other Home Visiting Programs). All Intensive In-Home Services (YVIntercept™ and Family Centered Treatment) may have no more than 5 cases per worker. Nurturing Families of Arkansas does not have a set number for a full-caseload, but rather use a work unit breakdown of direct service, time spent traveling to the family’s homes, and the preparation work needed to determine when a worker has a full case load.

# VII. Child Welfare Workforce Support

Pre-Print Section 5

The leadership at DCFS recognizes that the Division has several initiatives at this time (e.g., Structured Decision Making, Safety Organized Practice, restructuring Team Decision Making, the NCWWI Workforce Excellence grant, several new services including SafeCare and Intensive In-Home services, and implementing Family First). In the past, DCFS has struggled with presenting new initiatives in a cohesive way so that front line staff sees each piece as part of a whole and as integral to their work. This has resulted in inconsistency in implementation and a workforce that sees new initiatives as another checkbox instead of as a framework in which to do their job well. DCFS leadership has learned from this experience and is mitigating that with the following steps.

First, DCFS is holding a series of Zoom meetings called “Family First Fits Us” to discuss what Family First is, how it aligns with the DCFS value that every child in Arkansas deserves a safe, stable, and nurturing family every day, and to inform staff of Arkansas’s intent to implement Family First on Oct. 1, 2019. These are high level overviews and will be followed up by in person trainings for each area on the specifics of how to assess for eligibility, how to complete a prevention plan, and how to choose an appropriate evidence-based practice if available. There will also be follow up trainings for the changes occurring in foster care placements. As a follow up to the introductory Zoom meetings and to help support the implementation, the In-Home Program Manager will conduct coaching calls with supervisors to further their understanding of candidacy, prevention plans, and the chosen EBPs. These coaching calls will have several purposes:

1. How to determine candidacy correctly.
2. How to conduct prevention planning in a high-quality manner and how to use them in conjunction with the case plan.
3. How to determine which, if any EBP, is a good fit for a family.
4. How all these pieces fit together to improve practice.

Along with best practice issues, these coaching calls will also help with and address any issues with the technical aspects of filling the screens out correctly. These coaching calls will be held at least by area with some areas having multiple calls based on the number of supervisors. These calls will be held monthly during initial implementation and then held as needed. Coaching calls, Zoom meetings, or face-to-face sessions may also be provided to caseworkers if requested by county or unit supervisors. The In-Home Program Manager and Specialist will monitor the CHRIS Net reports made for candidacy and prevention plans to gauge where more training or coaching is needed as well.

In addition to the “Family First Fits Us” series, DCFS is creating a “brand” for the In-Home program including naming it “Stronger Together” and creating a website for front line staff. This website is purposefully designed to show a cohesive vision of the In-Home program and to help staff connect how Structured Decision Making, Safety Organized Practice, each chosen evidence-based practice, etc. all fit together. This will also be a place for staff to share success stories, look for resources, and give feedback regarding candidacy, prevention plans, and programs.




Traditionally, when new services are added, “Kick-Offs” are held to introduce the new service and provider to staff. When appropriate, “kick-offs” will be held when new Family First eligible services are added and become available in an area. DCFS has done “kick-offs” in each area as SafeCare and IIHS have rolled out. In addition, DCFS will implement “Service Cafés” in year two of implementation. These would serve to introduce staff to providers in their area and give them a chance to sit down and learn more about the service and ask questions, as well as allow providers to have the same opportunity. At each “Service Café” a portion of the time would be spent on helping workers “connect the dots” on how these services fit into Family First either as a family first eligible service or as a support to the EBPs.

The work DCFS is doing in collaboration with NCCD and NCCWI is integral to the success of its In-Home program and Family First implementation. NCCD is providing the support necessary to write policy revisions, create validated assessment tools, train, and coach staff on how to implement the safety-organized practice model and SDM. These training and coaching efforts are vital to support practice change and use SDM to fidelity. NCCD will also be providing continuous quality improvement activities over the next five years. While the NCCWI grant will help DCFS in several ways, one important aspect will be the NCWWI Leadership Academy for supervisors and managers. DCFS acknowledges that the key to success is quality supervision and as such this Leadership Academy will provide the needed support in improving the quality of front-line supervision in the state.

# VIII. Child Welfare Workforce Training

Building a strong workforce is a critical component in the Division’s efforts to build upon successes thus far in our system improvements. Making sure that our workers have the tools they need, giving them a manageable and equitable caseload, supporting and encouraging them, and ensuring the best legal support possible all combine to lead the way of our work in Phase Three over the last year.

DCFS partners with MidSouth, the community service branch of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR) School of Social Work, to provide new worker training for all Program Assistants (support role staff), Family Service Workers, and Supervisors. The Arkansas Academic Partnership in Public Child Welfare has nine IV-E university training partners, including UALR, that provide field training during the first year of employment for FSWs and supervisors as well as the quarterly in-service trainings mentioned in section VII. These trainings are to ensure that all front-line staff are competent, professional, trauma-informed, and have the skills necessary to do this work in a manner consistent with DCFS values. NCCD will be providing training and coaching for the implementation of SDM and SOP, which are foundational to accurately assessing risk and safety, over the course of implementation. Furthermore, these concepts as well as candidacy, prevention planning, and EBPs will be written into the curriculum for ongoing training of new FSWs.

DCFS caseworkers are hired as generalist family service workers and are expected to be able to perform all duties associated with front line casework. DCFS has a hybrid training model of online (self-directed) training, field training (as mentioned above). New FSWs participate in a five-week foundational training provided by Mid-South that addresses the Division’s Practice Model, trauma-informed child welfare practice, the dynamics of maltreatment, and assessments (CANS/FAST). In addition, all FSWs attend week-long concentration trainings through Mid-South in the areas of investigations, in-home cases, and foster care. While D.R. is touched upon in new family service worker training, a separate training provided




# IX. Consultation and Coordination

DCFS is committed to ensuring community engagement and stakeholder input in the implementation and expansion of Family First. In the recent past, DCFS conducted 44 focus groups across the state with stakeholders as part of its Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) Statewide Assessment and, as part of its root cause analysis efforts related to the CFSR Program Improvement Plan development, these additional focus groups were held: ten with front line workers and supervisors, one with Area Directors, three with agency attorneys, and three with legal stakeholders including judges, parent counsel, and attorney’s ad litem, one with Youth Advisory Board, and one with the Parent Advisory Council. Although not directly tied to Family First implementation, the feedback from these focus groups helped inform planning for Family First implementation.

The Division also held Family First Provider meetings with providers from across the state that serve DCFS clients, through foster care services and in-home services, to discuss the Family First Prevention Services Act and what it means for Arkansas families and for them. These meetings were to discuss services already in place, RFQs and RFPs being issued, and to elicit feedback from them regarding the direction DCFS is taking. The Assistant Director of Placement Support and Community Outreach, along with others in her unit, had one-on-one phone calls with placement providers to help them work through what FFPSA would mean for their facilities to help them to transition into FFPSA compliant models. DCFS also presented at the Children in the Courts Conference on Family First, which engaged the legal community, including judges, attorneys ad litem, parent counsel, and agency attorneys.

In June of 2018, the Division started the Parent Advisory Council (PAC). This council is made up of parents who have been involved with DCFS either through an investigation, a protective services case, a D.R., or have had their children placed in foster care. The PAC gave feedback and approval on the definition of candidacy and will continue to be involved in providing feedback and helping shape the direction of in-home services in Arkansas.38

Several of our PAC members completed NFA and wish for the Division to expand access to NFA.




council, they will also be represented in workgroups and will eventually assist in trainings and messaging efforts.

The Division and ARBest have collaborated in the past and are interested in collaborating again on the effort to increase access to trauma-informed therapy for adults. As discussed in section II, ARBest’s mission is to build a trauma-informed mental health system. They are best known for providing training for mental health professionals in trauma-informed therapeutic modalities. They have done significant work in training therapists across the state in TF-CBT and other trauma informed therapy for children and families. ARBest is now looking at training clinicians in trauma treatment for adults.

Going forward, the Division is implementing quarterly meetings with stakeholders and other divisions within the State, such as Medicaid, and the Division of Aging and Behavioral Health Services, in order to guide efforts in creating a continuum of care for families receiving prevention services. The Division is also creating an email for provider feedback and sharing of ideas.

For more information on the Division’s overall collaboration efforts, to include Family First implementation, please see the Collaboration Section of Arkansas’s 2020-2024 Child and Family Services Plan.
