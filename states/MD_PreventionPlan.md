# Section 1: Introduction

The Maryland Department of Human Services/Social Services Administration (DHS/SSA) envisions a Maryland where Families Blossom by strengthening families so that children are safe, healthy, resilient and are able to grow and thrive. Submitting this Title IV-E Prevention Plan is Maryland’s opportunity to continue to leverage all available resources to realize and sustain this vision.

# Seizing an Opportunity to Advance Maryland’s Strategic Vision

Maryland began a journey to reform our approach to child welfare in 2007 with the launch of the Place Matters initiative. Place Matters led to the provision of family-centered, child-focused, community-based services that promote safety, family strengthening, and permanence for children and families in the child welfare system. The primary success of Place Matters is evidenced by shorter lengths of stay in out-of-home placements, reduced entries into out-of-home placement and the increased number of children and youth exiting from foster care to permanent placement.

Building on Maryland’s previous successful improvement efforts, Maryland implemented the Title IV-E Waiver Demonstration Project (Waiver) in 2014, known as Families Blossom|Place Matters. Maryland used the flexibility afforded by the Waiver to focus on preventing new entries and reentries into foster care through the two key strategies: the meaningful use of assessments of families; and installing and testing a range of evidence-based and promising practices selected by local jurisdictions to meet the needs of their population. These strategies are mirrored in several provisions of the Family First Prevention Services Act (Families First), which makes Maryland well-positioned to implement them.

DHS/SSA’s vision is to transform the social service system in partnership with public agencies, private agencies, courts, and community partners, so that the children, youth, families, and vulnerable adults we serve and support are:

- Safe and free from maltreatment;
- Living in safe, supportive, and stable families where they can grow and thrive;
- Healthy and resilient with lasting family connections;
- Able to access a full array of high-quality services and supports that are designed to meet their needs; and
- Partnered with safe, engaged, and well-prepared professionals that effectively collaborate with individuals and families to achieve positive and lasting results.

DHS/SSA’s ongoing strategies for accomplishing these goals are to:

1. Promote safe, reliable, and effective practice through a strength-based, trauma-responsive practice model for child welfare and adult services.
2. Engage in a collaborative assessment process that is trauma-informed, culturally-responsive, and inclusive of formal and informal family and community partners.
3. Expand and align the array of services, resources, and evidence-based interventions available across child welfare and adult services based upon the assessed needs of



---

children, families, and vulnerable adults, to include additional resources aimed at preventing maltreatment and unnecessary out-of-home placements.

1. Invest in a safe, engaged and well-prepared professional workforce through training and other professional development including strong supervision and coaching.
2. Modernize DHS/SSA’s information technology to ensure timely access to data and greater focus on agency, individual, and family outcomes.
3. Strengthen the State and local continuous quality improvement processes by creating useful data resources to monitor performance, using evidence to develop performance improvement strategies, and meaningfully engaging internal and external stakeholders.

The title IV-E Prevention Services option authorized in Family First, provides an unprecedented opportunity for jurisdictions to be reimbursed for a portion of their investment into certain evidence-based parenting skills, substance use disorder prevention and treatment and mental health services when targeted to preventing children from entering foster care.1 Maryland taking advantage of the prevention option provides an opportunity to connect the end of the Waiver and our experiences in implementing evidence-based programs to prevent foster care, with a comprehensive prevention strategy for Maryland.

# Stakeholder and Partner Involvement in the Development of the Title IV-E Prevention Plan

DHS/SSA welcomed a collaborative effort in the development of the title IV-E Prevention Plan. Various stakeholders and partners directly contributed to the creation of this plan, learning along with DHS/SSA about the law’s provisions beginning in 2018 and engaging in a thorough exploration and assessment of the opportunities in taking advantage of this option. To engage stakeholders in this effort, Maryland built on its existing DHS/SSA’s Implementation Structure, which brings together system partners with a charge to advance key priorities to achieve the agency’s strategic direction.

DHS/SSA launched two key Family First-specific working groups beginning in the spring of 2019 that included a cross-section of local department of social service staff, community partners, providers, and stakeholders. The focus of these groups was to develop a strategy to strengthen and stabilize families preventing the need for foster care and decreasing the entry and re-entry of children and youth into foster care.

These included a Family First Core Team, comprised of headquarters staff and technical assistance (TA) partners to engage in overall assessment and readiness, as well as track steady progress towards planning and implementation of Family First. The core team spanned practice/program, policy, federal compliance, outcomes, and administrative roles to ensure that all adaptive, functional, and technical considerations could be a part of the planning for Family First implementation. A Family First Local Leaders Group was also convened to engage DHS local department Directors and Assistant Directors in planning and readying for implementation of Family First from a field perspective. DHS/SSA worked in partnership with Casey Family Programs to convene a series of Family First dialogues with service providers.

1 For a full summary of the Family First Prevention Services Act, including the prevention provisions, see the Children’s Bureau’s Information Memorandum, ACYF-CB-IM-18-02 available on https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/im1802.pdf.

---

These sessions were to share information, highlight the opportunities for transformation and identify challenges in Maryland’s early implementation of the Prevention Plan and ensure that DHS/SSA and providers could have a shared understanding of provider capacity-building needs.

As DHS/SSA began to explore the specific changes needed to achieve our desired outcomes for the Prevention Plan, DHS/SSA turned to its existing implementation teams or subgroups of these teams to review data analysis and existing business processes and develop recommendations for policy, practice and service changes or alignment. Specifically, the Protective Services and Family Preservation Implementation Team, which includes DHS/SSA and local staff, providers, community providers, and other stakeholders, assessed data analysis provided through SSA’s partnership with Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago and identified populations most at risk of entering foster care. Subgroups of this team built on an understanding of the data to formulate recommended candidacy definitions and risk criteria.

The Service Array Implementation Team, comprised of DHS/SSA and local leadership, technical assistance partners, parents with lived experience, and community partners, focused on identifying the evidence-based programs that could be leveraged and scaled, taking into consideration demonstrated success via the Waiver and other strategies. This team and a subgroup of the team took data and information on the potential population on candidates, scanned available evidence-based programs in operation in the state, examined apparent gaps in the array of evidence-based programs that could meet the needs of candidates and developed criteria for recommending the services in this plan.

# Consultation and Coordination on the Continuum of Prevention Services

In addition to the specific Family First focused convenings and workgroups, DHS/SSA has used the Implementation Teams to identify opportunities and mechanisms to ensure that services are coordinated on behalf of children at risk of entering foster care or pregnant and parenting youth. The Service Array Implementation Team has standing membership that brings together SSA program staff and medical director, Department of Health and Behavioral Health Administration representatives, local department leadership and staff, health providers and managed care representatives and family community members. The Service Array Implementation Team's charge is, in part, to evaluate and enhance local partnerships with community-based services and use evidence to develop and improve the service array. The Implementation Team is solution focused; looking to facilitate coordinated services and explore and address systemic barriers that impact service delivery.

Additionally, Maryland is facilitating local and regional town halls across the state, in the Summer and Fall of 2019. These town halls are intended to generate a shared understanding of the vision and opportunity in Maryland for improved family support services. The town halls will also engage partners in articulating how they can collectively contribute to the vision, leveraging tools such as Family First, the State’s five-year Child and Family Services Plan, and Maryland’s Child and Family Services Program Improvement Plan. Emerging from these town halls will be a Call to Action; a document outlining a locally-driven pathway for collective contributions to strengthening families and improving community-based services and systems support children and families.

Section 2: Prevention Services Eligibility and Candidacy Identification
There are two child populations eligible for Family First preventive services: 1) children who are determined to be candidates for foster care; and, 2) pregnant and parenting youth who are in foster care. When a child is determined eligible, the child, parent, and/or kin caregiver of the child may receive prevention services. DHS/SSA reviewed recent data in determining the population who could receive Title IV-E prevention services. Based on a thorough understanding of key populations afforded by a review of data, as described in the next sections, DHS/SSA and its partners reached a decision as to which children and families could be eligible for and ultimately receive services under the prevention plan.

# Identifying Candidates

Children at imminent risk of entering foster care will be defined as children who receive in-home services and who meet specific imminent risk criteria. Maryland chose not to include children who may have a contact with the agency but do not receive in-home services at this time, regardless of their risk level. To provide a sense of volume, the total children served in-home in SFY 2018 was 12,640 (versus a total screened out population of 135,883). Some percentage of the population served by in-home services would be defined as foster care candidates, depending on whether the child meets the imminent risk criteria. Maryland will continue to analyze data and may expand the candidacy description to include children who do not receive in-home services or refine the imminent risk criteria in later iterations of this plan. There is commitment by DHS/SSA to serve as many families as possible and appropriate through Title IV-E preventive services.

DHS/SSA will identify children at imminent risk if they meet any of the following criteria represented in Figure 1. The criteria are not mutually exclusive.

# Figure 1. Imminent Risk Criteria for Candidates

| Risk of Harm                                 | Substance Use Disorder                              | Victims of Trafficking                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Families in Unsafe Living Conditions.        | Families with Complex Medical Needs.                | Families with Complex Psychological and/or Behavioral Needs. |
| Families with Prior Child Welfare experience | Current Department of Juvenile Services involvement | Informal Kinship Living Arrangement.                         |

Families with identified risk of harm. This includes families that may need additional support because they have characteristics that have been found to elevate the risk of harm to the child and thus the potential for entering foster care. Specifically, this includes families who come to the attention of the local department because of a health provider notification of a substance-exposed newborn; domestic violence situations involving a minor; cases where there is an identified substantial risk of child sexual abuse due to a known sexual offender living with the child; and caregivers who have impairments that are likely to cause harm to a child. Other risk of harm situations include a family who has experienced a prior child fatality or serious child injury; situations in which there is previous report to child protective services (CPS) and there is currently a child age 5 or younger living in the home; and “Birth Match” cases in which a parent has previously had their parental rights terminated due to abuse or neglect and a subsequent child is born to the parent. Approximately 20% of families served with in-home cases exclusively are cases involving risk of harm.

Families experiencing substance use disorder. Parental substance use disorders have been a leading circumstance associated with children entering foster care in Maryland, impacting approximately one quarter of entries in recent years and about 4 percent related to caregiver alcohol abuse3. Child substance and alcohol use disorders are a factor in approximately 7% of removals. Due to the potential to lead to behavior which significantly disrupts the home environment and caregiver protective capacities, we identified substance use disorders of the parent, child/youth, and or other household member as one of the imminent risk criteria.

Victims of trafficking. DHS/SSA is considering all forms of trafficking, human or labor trafficking, or sex-trafficking in this category. Research suggests that there is a significant intersection between youth who are or have been involved in the child welfare system and trafficking victimization4. Maryland’s data indicates that 877 children came into contact with our local departments due to sex trafficking in particular, but just less than 10% received an in-home service. By identifying trafficked young people as a risk criteria, DHS/SSA seeks to expand access to prevention services that may keep children connected to their families when appropriate or address vulnerable youth exiting foster care.

Families in unsafe living conditions. Approximately 9% of children enter foster care in Maryland with inadequate housing as a factor in their placement. DHS/SSA understands that unsafe housing, including homelessness, creates significant family instability, elevating parental stressors which can lead to maltreatment and safety concerns for children.5

Families with complex medical needs. Families experiencing complex medical needs involve a myriad of situations, such as parents with medical challenges, medically fragile.

# Identifying Families at Risk of Entering Foster Care

Children, children with significant disabilities who need specialized care to ensure their health and safety, and children who are reported by health care practitioners to local departments as experiencing failure to thrive. It is difficult to specifically identify all of these situations in the data, but DHS/SSA believes that these families may need additional support to build their caregiving capacity and prevent entry into foster care when children are particularly vulnerable or parental health is challenged.

# Families with complex psychological and/or behavioral needs

Similar to the above, parents, caregivers and children who have complex psychological and/or behavioral needs are particularly vulnerable, often factoring into a child’s placement into care. Data indicate that children’s behavior is a factor in approximately 15% of entries into foster care and voluntary placements.

# Families with prior child welfare experience

Once a family has had some experience with the child welfare system, they are at higher risk of having additional involvement. For this reason, DHS/SSA identified families with a prior history of maltreatment, children/families involved in family preservation cases, children who have exited to some form of permanency, minors who leave care before turning age 21, and siblings of children in foster care who reside at home, as all at elevated risk for entering foster care. In particular, reentries into foster care within 12 months from reunification are at 16.2%, persistently above Maryland’s target of 12% and trending in the wrong direction, indicating a need to continue to focus on supporting families who have come to the agency’s attention or have experienced out of home placement.

# Children and youth with current Department of Juvenile Services involvement

DHS/SSA identified youth who are involved with juvenile services as at risk of entering or reentering an out of home placement. This population is a focus as we understand the intersection between those who have experienced maltreatment and engage in delinquent behaviors and could benefit from prevention services to avoid placement.

# Informal kinship living arrangement

Kinship families who are not formally involved with the child welfare system may need additional supports to ensure that children can thrive and remain with their families. Maryland served at least 1,000 families through its Kinship Navigator programs in SFY2018; providing them with referrals to community services and access to concrete assistance. DHS/SSA believes that this is an undercount due to inconsistencies in how these services are recorded within MD CHESSIE.

# Identifying Pregnant and Parenting Foster Youth

Since Family First identifies pregnant and parenting foster youth as a uniquely eligible population for prevention services, workers will assess each pregnant and parenting youth in foster care to see if they need a prevention plan to support their healthy parenting and avoid their children being placed away from them. In exploring the data, we identified 83 young people in foster care on June 30, 2018, who are parenting and receiving in-home services on behalf of 49 children. DHS/SSA believes this number does not account for all youth in foster care who are pregnant or parenting as there is some inconsistency across local departments in reporting this circumstance and how such young people receive parenting supports.

Determining and Documenting Eligibility

DHS/SSA carefully explored considerations, including pros and cons, for implementing a process to identify candidates and pregnant and parenting youth for prevention services. As Maryland is in the midst of a transition from our current case management system, Maryland’s Children Electronic Social Services Information Exchange (MD CHESSIE) to an improved system known as Maryland Child, Juvenile and Adult Management System (MD CJAMS), DHS/SSA’s ability to make significant changes within the current system is limited. As such, the process for identifying eligible families and documenting eligibility is semi-structured consistent with the capabilities of the current system.

A family’s acceptance of in-home services and applicability of one of the imminent risk criteria is recorded in existing intake, assessment tools and data fields in MD CHESSIE. Workers will be directed by policy to review MD CHESSIE to identify potential candidates because there is imminent risk. Similarly out-of-home workers identify a young person’s pregnant or parenting status within MD CHESSIE based on intake, assessment tools and other interactions with the young person. Even though imminent risk exists for a child or a young parent is identified, there is still a clinical determination to be made as to whether the family needs prevention services and a prevention plan to avoid foster care or build parenting capacity.

The caseworker, in conjunction with a supervisor, will make this clinical decision as to whether Family First prevention services are the appropriate course of action for this child/family and that they are within the target population for a specific evidence-based service in this Plan. The worker and supervisor will arrive at this decision using findings from the risk assessment, safety assessment and Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths -Family version functional assessment tool (CANS-F), where appropriate. These tools along with authentic partnership and engagement of the family or young person will inform the identification of family strengths and needs, support co-creation of the prevention plan and selection of the most appropriate and effective evidence-based program. The final decision that a child is determined a candidate or pregnant/parenting youth eligible for prevention services will be recorded and dated within the Service Plan in MD CHESSIE. Any worker redeterminations of eligibility will also be captured in MD CHESSIE.

DHS/SSA will revisit the ability to initially identify imminent risk and pregnant/parenting youth (prior to worker/supervisor decision-making) as a more structured and automated effort as we roll out CJAMS. Similarly, we will continue to explore how future data fields can record the date and other aspects of the eligibility determination.

# Section 3: Title IV-E Prevention Services Description and Implementation Plan

Maryland has selected an array of prevention programs for this plan that meet the evidence levels required by Family First and best align with the needs of children identified as at imminent risk of entering foster care, pregnant/parenting young people and their families. These services were identified through robust analysis of data on the needs and characteristics of potential candidates.

# Proposed Evidence-Based Preventive Services

Table 1 represents the programs that Maryland is requesting in its Prevention Plan that align with the needs of Maryland’s target population and are currently rated by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse (Clearinghouse) as having achieved an approvable evidence rating.

| Program Type  | Evidenced Based Program          | Clearinghouse Rating |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Parenting     | Healthy Families America         | Well-Supported       |
| Parenting     | Nurse Family Partnership         | Well-Supported       |
| Parenting     | Functional Family Therapy        | Supported            |
| Mental Health | Parent Child Interaction Therapy | Well-Supported       |
| Mental Health | Multisystemic Therapy            | Well-Supported       |

Healthy Families America (HFA). HFA is a home visiting program with a goal of preventing abuse or neglect or intervening with families at high risk of abuse and neglect. Families are eligible to receive HFA services beginning prenatally or within three months of birth. When referred from child welfare, families may be enrolled with a child up to twenty-four months of age. This program is designed to serve the families of children who have increased risk for maltreatment or other adverse childhood experiences.

Nurse Family Partnership (NFP). NFP is a home-visiting program where nurses provide support related to individualized goal setting, preventative health practices, parenting skills, and educational and career planning, based on the needs/requests of the parent. It targets young, first-time low-income mothers from early pregnancy through the child’s first two years. Given this program’s target population, it may be most suited to pregnant and parenting youth in foster care or families with low risk who are referred to SSA due to their newborn’s substance exposure.

Functional Family Therapy (FFT). FFT is a short-term, high-quality intervention program for youth demonstrating behavioral health problems. The target population is pre-teens to teens with serious concerns such as conduct disorder, violent acting-out, and substance abuse. Approximately 15% of children entering foster care in Maryland have the child’s behavior being a factor in the placement, indicating a significant need for programs such as FFT.



---

# Parent Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT)

PCIT is a behavioral parent training program with coaching by a trained therapist in behavior-management and relationship skills. It targets 2-7 year olds with emotional/behavioral issues and their parents/caregivers.

# Multisystemic Therapy (MST)

MST is an intensive family and community-based treatment for serious juvenile offenders with possible substance abuse issues and their families. It targets youth, ages 12 to 17 years old, with possible substance abuse issues who are at risk of out-of-home placement due to antisocial or delinquent behaviors.

The next set of interventions, represented in Table 2, are not rated by the Clearinghouse as of the submission of this plan. However, DHS/SSA research indicates that these programs have demonstrable evidence that makes them approvable by the Children’s Bureau.

| Program Type           | Evidenced Based Program               | Evidence Source and Rating                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Parenting              | Nurturing Parenting Program           | Pending Clearinghouse review CEBC - Promising  |
| Mental Health          | Family Centered Treatment             | Anticipated systematic review CEBC – Promising |
| Substance Use Disorder | Sobriety Treatment and Recovery Teams | Anticipated systematic review CEBC – Promising |

These programs represent important elements of Maryland’s service array that are already implemented and would be beneficial to continue or expand.

# Nurturing Parenting Program (NPP)

NPP for Parents and their Infants, Toddlers and Preschoolers is a family-centered program designed for the prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect. Both parents and their children birth to five years participate in home-based, group-based, or combination group-based and home-based program models. Lessons are competency-based ensuring parental learning and mastery of skills. The program lessons focus on remediating five parenting patterns known to form the basis of maltreatment. The Nurturing Parenting Program for Parents and their School Age Children 5 to 12 Years is a 15-session program that is group-based and family-centered. As home visiting programs for parents of children from pregnancy to age 2 are the most prevalent type of evidence-based parenting skills programs in Maryland, the Nurturing Parenting Program represents a program that targets parents of children up to the middle years and can thus reach an essential part of our target population.

# Sobriety Treatment and Recovery Teams (START)

START is an intensive child welfare program for families with co-occurring substance use and child maltreatment delivered in an integrated manner with local addiction treatment services. The program targets families with at least one child 5 or younger in the child welfare system and have a parent.

---

where substance use is a primary child safety risk factor. Maryland used its Waiver to invest in a needs assessment as well as fit and readiness activities prior to selecting and beginning installation of START in over half of Maryland’s jurisdictions. START is uniquely situated to address the needs of families with young children affected by substance use disorders, which is a significant group within our target population. Data shows that there were 2,568 substance exposed newborn notifications to local departments in SFY2018, 1,534 of them receiving in-home services. As mentioned early, approximately one quarter of entries into foster care are associated with parental substance use – many of whom have young children. Approval of START via the Prevention Plan offers Maryland the opportunity to continue and potentially expand DHS/SSA initial investment in START.

Family Centered Treatment (FCT), is a well-established and evaluated intervention available in all jurisdictions in Maryland with a focus on youth involved in the juvenile justice system. FCT is designed to find simple, practical, and common sense solutions for families faced with disruption or dissolution of their family. It is targeted towards family members at imminent risk of placement into, or needing intensive services to return from, treatment facilities, foster care, group or residential treatment, psychiatric hospitals, or juvenile justice facilities. Since FCT has been used particularly effectively with crossover youth, Family First provides Maryland the ability to expand its use to child welfare populations and potential crossover youth who are at imminent risk of foster care.

All of the programs in Table 2 have been rated by the California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse (CEBC) for Child Welfare as highly relevant to child welfare and as promising interventions. One of these programs, NPP, is pending review by the federal Clearinghouse review as of September 2019 and Maryland anticipates that it will meet one of the required evidence levels. Maryland is considering the remaining two programs, FCT and START, for a systematic review. SSA has become aware of other states that are similarly interested in pursuing a systematic review for these two programs based on the strength of evidence. SSA respectfully request that the Children’s Bureau and the Administration for Children and Families prioritize these programs for review in the Clearinghouse.

Finally, Maryland has identified additional services that would meet the needs of our families that are not included here for a variety of reasons. Maryland intends to submit additional iterations of this plan as more programs are approved by the federal government, DHS/SSA engages in additional planning around the implementation, training and evaluation of those programs, and Maryland works with the provider community to further expand effective services. Further, Maryland remains committed to using all available resources and funding sources to ensure that there is a quality array of services to strengthen families and prevent foster care.

Please see Appendix C for a summary of all proposed evidence-based interventions, including a brief description of the program and target population, evidence ratings, intended outcomes and current scope of the program across Maryland.

# Trauma Informed Framework

A key criteria for selecting the evidence-based services included in this plan was that the service itself had a trauma-informed approach. DHS/SSA identified whether a service has a trauma-informed approach by several methods:

- Identification as a trauma-informed intervention on the National Child Traumatic Stress Network website;
- Listed as a trauma treatment on the California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse (CEBC);
- and/or;
- Otherwise described as including trauma-informed approaches via the CEBC, another federal clearinghouse such as the Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness (HOMVEE) review project, or the purveyor’s websites or other literature.

One of Maryland’s core strategies for implementing its vision is to promote safe, reliable and effective practice through a strength-based, trauma-responsive practice model for child welfare and adult services. As described in Maryland’s 2020 - 2024 Child and Family Services Plan, DHS/SSA will integrate the practice model into our standard contract language for providers. This includes ensuring that providers are using a trauma-informed framework and co-creating with providers the standard reporting methods and metrics to assess their delivery of trauma informed care.

DHS/SSA anticipates at least annual monitoring of the trauma-informed framework, consistent with our contracts review and continuous quality improvement strategy. In particular, DHS/SSA currently requires placement providers to complete a Program Questionnaire to gather comprehensive information about the services offered and youth served by programs that are utilized by the Department of Juvenile Services and local departments of social services. This information is used to describe the service array, to identify gaps in services, and to improve service matching based on youth characteristics, including identified risks, needs, and strengths.

Included in the Program Questionnaire is the following set of questions related to the provision of trauma informed care.

- Written policies and procedures are established based on an understanding of the impact of trauma on children, youth and families.
- Staff members have regular team meetings and/or supervision where topics related to trauma and self-care are addressed.
- Every child has a written crisis-prevention plan that includes: list of triggers; list of ways child shows they are stressed/overwhelmed; specific strategies that are helpful/not helpful when a child is feeling upset/overwhelmed; list of people the child feels safe around/can go to for support.
- Based on trauma screening and the intake assessment, children are referred for further assessment and trauma-specific services by providers with expertise in trauma.
- The program educates children, youth and families about traumatic stress and triggers.
- Staff at all levels of the program receive training and education that includes what traumatic stress is, how traumatic stress affects the body and brain, and the relationship between mental health and trauma.

---


Providers implementing an evidence-based program under DHS/SSA prevention plan will be required, through a contractual obligation, to answer a similar set of questions to ensure that their services are delivered within a trauma informed framework.

See Appendix D for Maryland’s assurance that each service and program in this plan is delivered under an organizational structure and treatment framework that involves understanding, recognizing, and responding to the effects of all types of trauma and in accordance with recognized principles of a trauma-informed approach.

# Implementation Approach

Maryland selected its services for this plan with a focus on the feasibility of implementation. In particular, consistent with the National Implementation Research Network’s Hexagon exploration tool7, DHS/SSA explored and considered whether programs demonstrate evidence, whether there are implementation supports, and usability. Maryland’s experience with Waiver also provided us with valuable lessons which influenced our selection of services and informs our approach to ongoing examination of implementation and sustainability. SSA selected programs for this plan that have been installed and have an existing provider base in at least five jurisdictions, ensuring that there is both reach and efficiencies of scale. SSA also selected programs that had some level of established fidelity and/or outcomes monitoring consistent with purveyor criteria.

As the programs have already been installed, Maryland will implement Family First initially utilizing existing DHS/SSA contracts and/or expanding contracts and memoranda of understanding with sister agencies for those programs that have been primarily supported through another public agency.

Primary responsibility for the development and implementation of the Title IV-E Prevention Plan rests with the Implementation Teams. These teams are further informed and guided by the Outcomes Improvement Steering Committee within Maryland’s existing Implementation structure. These teams include representatives from the stakeholder and provider community, including families and youth, advisory and advocacy groups, community providers, university partners, the court system, and the Families Blossom evaluation team. The Implementation Structure allows for:

- Real-time refinements and enhancements during development and implementation;
- Identification and allocation of needed resources;
- Promotion of timely policy and programmatic decisions;
- Continual tracking and monitoring of progress towards identified outcomes; and
- Managing and sustaining the desired change.

The Implementation Teams will take information synthesized through continuous quality improvement and evaluation activities to ensure that the Prevention Plan is meeting agency goals and to address and resolve any organizational or systemic challenges or barriers. Please see the continuous quality improvement strategy section below for additional information on how Maryland will engage in ongoing activities to inform and enhance successful implementation.

# Section 4: Child-Specific Prevention Plan

# Developing Child-Specific Prevention Plans and Connecting Families to Services

Family Service plans will be developed in collaboration with the child, if age and developmentally appropriate, and the child’s caregiver(s). Child-specific prevention plans will be subsets to each Family Service Plan within MD CHESSIE. For pregnant and parenting foster youth, these services should be documented in the foster youth’s service plan, specifying those services that will ensure the youth is prepared and able to parent successfully. Child Welfare staff will engage individual family members in understanding the needs and strengths of each person in the family and will capture the information using CANS-F assessment for candidates or the CANS for pregnant/parenting youth. The family and/or child in consultation with the applicable caseworker will identify what service needs the family and/or child are willing and able to focus on at any given time to help ensure the child’s safety, mitigate risk of future maltreatment and prevent foster care or strengthen parenting capacity. Child welfare staff will offer information about available services to address identified needs that are available taking into account and resolving any barriers that might exist for the family or child to receive an appropriate service.

# Ongoing Monitoring and Coordination of the Child-Specific Prevention Plan

Staff will maintain frequent and regular contact with service providers and the family to support service provision, assess progress made and/or help identify any adjustments needed to services. While in many local departments families and pregnant/parenting youth receiving prevention services will be assigned a specialized family preservation worker, there may be times when child protective services are serving in this role, out of home care workers are involved with serving pregnant or parenting youth, or case associates are assigned in addition to ongoing workers to address families who have a higher level of needs. Multiple workers for a family will function as a team. When case transfers need to occur, the agency will ensure a “warm” hand off of the family to the new worker to ensure continuity of relationships, engagement and services. For more information about staff practices and workforce development see section 7.

# Section 5: Monitoring Child Safety and Assessing Risk

Initial and ongoing assessments of safety and risk are an integral part of the work of Maryland’s child welfare staff. As candidates for foster care will be receiving in-home services or be pregnant and parenting youth in foster care, DHS/SSA will use existing practices to ensure child safety and assess risk. Caseworkers (both In-Home and Out-of-Home Placement Services staff) conduct their assessments face-to-face with all children and families while considering information from other sources, such as school and medical staff, therapists, etc.



---


Assessment requires supervisory approval following at least monthly case consultation between the worker and supervisor.

Caseworkers are required to make, at a minimum, monthly face-to-face visits with a family, including meeting privately with the child. The frequency of visitation and contact is determined by the assessed safety and risk levels. Table 3 outlines the frequency of staff face-to-face contact with families receiving in-home services.

# Table 3. Guidelines for determining frequency of face-to-face contact

| Safety Determination | Risk Rating               | Service Intensity Level | Worker Contact with Parents and All Children in Household                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unsafe               | High                      | Level 1                 | Level I cases will maintain a minimum of three hours of face-to-face contact per week                          |
| Conditionally Safe   | High                      | Level II                | Level II cases will maintain a minimum of three hours of direct face-to-face contact over a two-week period    |
| Conditionally Safe   | Moderate                  | Level III               | Level III cases will maintain a minimum of three hours of direct face-to-face contact over a thirty-day period |
| Safe                 | High                      |                         |                                                                                                                |
| Safe                 | Moderate, Low, or no risk |                         |                                                                                                                |

Out of home workers visit children at least monthly, with more frequent visits for certain children depending on need and type of placement.

During all family and child contact, caseworkers are continuously assessing:

- New safety issues and unaddressed risk factors;
- Progress toward reducing ongoing safety issues or risk factors;
- Progress toward meeting case objectives and service receipt and progress; and,
- Barriers to progress in improving child safety or reducing risk factors upon review of service provision and progress by contracted providers.

Maryland’s protocols and tools for assessing and monitoring the safety of children are longstanding. For children receiving in-home services or with their families on a trial home visit in preparation for reunification, workers use the Maryland Safety Assessment for Every Child tool (SAFE-C). Maryland’s SAFE-C allows workers to assess a child’s vulnerabilities as well as any protective factors that may exist to help mitigate safety concerns. Out-of-Home Placement Services staff use the Maryland Safety Assessment for Every Child Out-of-Home-Placement (SAFE-C OHP) to assess the safety of children in active Out-of-Home placement up to their 21st birthday, including pregnant and parenting youth. This tool is used to assess youth in every type of placement or living arrangement (i.e., kinship, regular foster homes, private treatment agency homes, group homes, and residential treatment centers). Figure 2 provides an outline of key timeframes and milestones in which safety is assessed.



---


# Figure 2. Key safety assessment milestones for in-home and out-of-home care

- Immediately following a face to face contact with an alleged victim and contact or attempted contact with the caregiver;
- Within 7 working days of case acceptance in FP;
- Within 10 working days of the assignment or transfer of the case to the caseworker;
- Within 7 working days prior to completing a case reconsideration or closure;
- When the caseworker discovers there is a significant change in the composition of the home;
- When circumstances suggest that the child's safety may be jeopardized; and
- When a Safety Plan is re-evaluated.

# Candidates for Foster Care (In Home Services)

- At initial placement or movement to another placement resource

# Pregnant and Parenting Youth (Out of Home)

- Every 180 days as part of the reconsidering the need for care
- When the worker becomes aware of a situation which may place a child’s safety in danger

Child welfare staff are also required to monitor risk of future maltreatment. The Maryland Family Risk Assessment (MFRA) tool helps the worker to formally assess and identify risk factors in the family. Risk assessments are completed prior to the receipt of ongoing services in the home, at least every 3 months during ongoing services and to prepare for the end of services and closing the family’s case.

# Section 6: Evaluation and Continuous Quality Improvement Strategy

Family First requires that each program in the Prevention Plan have a well-designed and rigorous evaluation strategy, unless granted a federal waiver of the requirement. Maryland intends to use the evaluation requirement for Family First to continue to further its research to practice agenda related to prevention services. Maryland will be working with the evaluation team at the University of Maryland School of Social Work (UMB/SSW) to ensure that evaluation or continuous quality improvement (CQI) efforts identified for each evidence-based program in the Prevention Plan are implemented. DHS/SSA contracts with UMB/SSW to support its current CQI and evaluation activities. UMB/SSW has extensive experience supporting several of the interventions in this plan and more generally in providing key technical assistance. In terms of evaluation, UMB/SSW has partnered with DHS/SSA to conduct evaluation, research, and data collection activities, including compilation and analysis of service utilization, fidelity, satisfaction, fiscal, and participant outcomes data. In addition to its partnership with the UMB/SSW to evaluate programs in the Prevention Plan, DHS/SSA is exploring additional evaluation and CQI partnership opportunities with the Maryland Department of Health and Department of Juvenile Services, where appropriate.

Evaluation Waiver for Well-Supported Interventions

Maryland is seeking a waiver for those evidence-based programs designated at the well-supported evidence level by the Title IV-E Prevention Clearinghouse (Clearinghouse). These evidence-based programs include Healthy Families America (HFA), Nurse Family Partnership (NFP), Parent Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), Multisystemic Therapy (MST), and Functional Family Therapy (FFT). Table 4 identifies the programs subject to an evaluation and those for which Maryland is requesting a waiver. Maryland reserves the right to update its waiver requests based on the latest available information from the Clearinghouse at the time of the approval of this plan. See Appendix E for Maryland’s official evaluation waiver requests for well-supported interventions.

# Table 4. Evaluation or requested CQI per evidence-based program

| Type                   | Evidence-Based Program                | Evaluation | CQI (evaluation waiver request) |

# CQI Strategy

As part of Maryland’s Waiver, DHS/SSA in collaboration with UMB/SSW, implemented a CQI strategy to support effective implementation of identified evidence-based programs (i.e. MST, FFT, PCIT, and NPP). This strategy included program level and agency-wide CQI activities for gathering, monitoring, analyzing and reporting out utilization, fidelity, and outcomes for specified EPBs implemented as part of the Waiver. Data gathered specifically included demographic characteristics of the families/children served, utilization, case processing, fidelity, discharges, dosage, and pre/post outcomes which were shared monthly and quarterly with local departments, evidence-based program providers, and DHS/SSA. Additionally, monthly implementation calls were held with local departments, technical assistance partners, providers, and a model expert for the particular evidence-based program to identify what is working, identify any barriers, and identify solutions.

As part of the Prevention Plan DHS/SSA will continue to partner with UMB/SSA to enhance and expand these processes to include the additional well-supported evidence-based programs included in Maryland’s Prevention Plan (i.e. HFA, NFP, PCIT, and MST).

# Data Management and Implementation Strategies

Include collecting and managing data from evidence-based program providers and purveyors, data cleaning (including ongoing calls/communication with providers), maintaining data sharing agreements and IRB protocols, communicating with purveyors (as needed), and linking data across multiple sources for analysis and reporting. Provider specific and aggregated implementation reports will be created and shared with DHS/SSA, local departments, provider staff and other stakeholders on a frequency tailored to the evidence-based program model and implementation phase/status. These systematic reports will assist with assessing and enhancing implementation efforts as part of the CQI framework. The annual report will include matched data from state administrative databases for the purposes of determining longitudinal outcomes. Ad hoc analyses will be conducted and summarized in brief presentations or reports to inform specific questions throughout the course of implementation.

In addition, DHS/SSA will work with UMB/SSW to ensure collaboration among key stakeholders in program level CQI and use of data to guide implementation strategies by:

1. Convening regular meetings with the purveyors to coordinate implementation activities (e.g., training), discuss/resolve implementation issues, and plan for program changes, as needed;
2. Supporting training and technical assistance for DHS/SSA, local departments, and provider partners to form and maintain implementation teams;
3. Supporting the provision of on-going technical assistance to local implementation teams to use data to identify implementation challenges and to develop strategies and solutions;
4. Supporting the development and facilitation of an evidence-based program Stakeholder Collaborative to include opportunities for public and private agencies across jurisdictions to share data, outcomes, implementation challenges, and potential strategies for improvements.

At the agency level, Maryland will integrate the data and implementation reports into its ongoing CQI processes. As noted above, CQI is carried out within DHS/SSA’s Implementation Structure, an organizational structure nested within DHS/SSA in partnership with system partners, to advance key priorities in order to achieve the agency’s strategic direction. Figure 3 shows the CQI cycle operationalized in Maryland.

Keep the OISC informed of progress on implementing solutions and results. OISC provides input as needed to support ongoing work.

# IMPLEMENTATION TEAM CQI REVIEW OF PERFORMANCE CYCLE

Prioritize Performance Issues

Presentation to OISC to highlight key successes and concerns; OISC recommends issues to pursue further and approves next steps.

# Investigate factors contributing to performance issues

Identify potential solutions through additional data analysis, other data sources, & consultation with staff; locals, & other stakeholders.

During the first year of Family First, the CQI cycle will focus on a review of data and information related to implementation, including but not limited to data to address the process evaluation questions noted below. This will provide SSA with a firm understanding of how evidence-based programs are being implemented, the status of implementation drivers and supports and allow for proactive management of the evidence-based programs to ensure implementation success. In subsequent years, proximal and distal outcomes will be examined, as data become available and as implementation stabilizes sufficiently to allow for outcomes assessment.

Finally, DHS/SSA engages each local jurisdiction as they participate in Maryland Child and Family Service Reviews (CFSR) with a focused discussion on the local department’s performance. This discussion focuses on DHS/SSA headline indicators related to safety, permanency and well-being, the story that provides context for that performance and the use of particular approaches interventions that may impact child and family outcomes. DHS/SSA and the local department identify areas of outstanding performance and those in need of improvement during this engagement and couple them with the local department’s MD CFSR findings to guide the local department's improvement efforts.

that some of the children and families served by the Prevention Plan will be a part of the cases sampled to undergo a qualitative review in a MD CFSR, allowing SSA an additional opportunity to explore the contributions of prevention programs to child and family outcomes and areas for improvement.

# Evaluation Strategy

DHS/SSA has included three evidence-based programs in this Prevention Plan that currently are not identified as well-supported by the Clearinghouse: Family Centered Treatment (FCT), Sobriety Treatment and Recovery Teams (START), and Nurturing Parenting Program (NPP).

The evaluation strategy for each will be designed to meet the particular circumstances of each evidence-based program. For FCT and START, DHS/SSA will develop an evaluation plan. NPP is pending rating at the Clearinghouse, if it receives a well-supported rating DHS/SSA will request a waiver; if it does not receive a well-supported rating, an evaluation plan will be developed.

Once the initial list of prevention programs is reviewed and approved by the Children’s Bureau, DHS/SSA will work with UMB/SSW to develop a specific evaluation plan to determine the evaluation questions, appropriate measures, indicators, data sources, and analytic approaches for each intervention that is not rated as well-supported by the Clearinghouse. Included in our evaluation strategy will be the development of a dissemination plan to share the evaluation findings.

# Research Questions

SSA plans to use a mixed-methods approach to conduct process and outcome evaluations of the promising and supported evidenced based programs included in the Prevention Plan. Preliminary research questions that have been identified to drive the evaluations and our CQI efforts include:

# Processes:

- To what extent was the program delivered with fidelity to the program model?
- To what extent did the service get delivered to the target population of evidence-based program?
- To what extent did targeted populations enroll and to what extent did they sustain participation?
- To what extent did DHS/SSA (and sister agencies and partners, as applicable) support implementation of the evidence-based program?

# Outcomes:

- To what extent are participating children and families experiencing better mental health, substance abuse, and parenting outcomes as prescribed by each evidence-based program model?
- To what extent has the program kept a child from entering foster care within one and two years of receipt of the evidence-based program?

In addition, SSA will examine research questions that transcend individual evidence-based programs and instead examine the degree to which the state’s comprehensive prevention strategy is working. These questions may include:



---


# To what extent is the Family First eligibility assessment and documentation process being performed consistently by workers?

# To what extent are families being referred to the right services to meet their needs?

# To what extent does SSA’s preventive service array align with the needs of the target populations?

# To what extent is SSA’s coordination and collaboration successful with sister agencies on individual shared cases?

# Section 7: Child Welfare Workforce Training and Support

# Training and Supporting the Evidence-Based Program Provider Agency Workforce

As indicated earlier in the Prevention Plan, all evidence-based programs are administered within a trauma-informed framework and our array of services in this plan build on an existing provider network. As such, Maryland enters into this plan with an accomplished workforce with the skills and capacities necessary to deliver the evidence-based programs. Via the Program Questionnaire, described earlier in this plan, compliance with the all of the trauma informed requirements will be reviewed annually by DHS/SSA staff.

DHS/SSA recognizes that ongoing training is needed in order to support continuous learning and growth. As contracts or agreements expand the scale of programs, DHS/SSA will require evidence-based program providers to provide initial and ongoing trauma training to sustain the trauma-informed framework, meet the necessary training, credentialing and fidelity monitoring requirements of each model, and take advantage of additional training and coaching offered by the evidence-based program purveyor. Additionally, the technical assistance DHS/SSA provides in conjunction with UMB/SSW, will ensure that both public and private workers and clinicians have the opportunity for collaborative peer-learning opportunities. DHS/SSA will also explore opportunities to offer additional training if needed, including collaborating with sister agencies on training existing and new providers.

# Training and Supporting the Child Welfare Agency Workforce

DHS/SSA, in partnership with the Child Welfare Academy (CWA), currently offers a robust curriculum of Pre-Service, Foundations and In-service trainings that align with various components of the Prevention Plan. This trainings series, coupled with SSA’s newly developed and implemented Integrated Practice Model (IPM), will integrate and build upon each other to ensure best practice and desired outcomes to children and families served under the Prevention Plan.

Pre-Service is a six-week training series required by law for all new child welfare staff. Workers must successfully complete pre-service training and pass a competency exam. The training series is designed to equip new workers with foundational knowledge, skills and competencies to meet the complex needs of children and families involved in the various facets of the child welfare system, and to improve safety, permanency and well-being outcomes of children and families. The six training modules include:

1. Foundations of Practice
2. Indicators and Dynamics of Abuse and Neglect and Three Contributing Factors
3. Engaging with Children and Families
4. Conducting Family



---

# Centered Assessments

# 5. Planning with the Family

# 6. Working Effectively with the Court

Modules 1 through 5 in particular will be refined to bolster the Prevention Plan. Foundations Track Training Series is also required for new child welfare workers and builds upon the knowledge and skills introduced in pre-service with a more intensive focus on practice competencies and transfer of learning opportunities to the actual work setting. All new child welfare workers are required to complete the two-day Assessing and Planning for Risk and Safety Course and are then enrolled in one of three tracks: Introduction to Child Protective Service Responses, Introduction to Family Preservation or Introduction to Placement and Permanency. These will be modified to incorporate aspects of the Prevention Plan as needed.

In-Service trainings are on-going and ever-evolving to meet the diverse needs of the state-wide workforce. These trainings encompass a variety of interests, knowledge and skill development areas. Currently there are over 100 in-service trainings offered each year covering a range of specialized topics in human behavior, family assessment and engagement, family health and well-being, cultural competency, trauma informed care and evidenced based practice. Maryland will add specific trainings that focus on the components of the Prevention Plan.

Maryland’s Integrated Practice Model (IPM) was designed with the ultimate goal of achieving better outcomes for children, families and vulnerable adults served throughout Maryland. The model is predicated on the CARE-Collaboration, Advocacy, Respect and Empowerment framework. The IPM provides an integrated, individualized and standardized framework for children and families and incorporates the following practice principles: trauma-responsive, family-centered, culturally & linguistically responsive, outcomes-driven, individualized and strength-based, safe, engaged and well-prepared professional workforce and community-focused. All current Maryland child welfare staff will receive training on the IPM which will be the foundation for all case work practice provided in service to children and families. In addition, the IPM will become the foundation for all pre-service and in-service learning opportunities for child welfare staff.

Maryland has begun initial training on the IPM through various forums and will be providing more intensive training throughout the Fall of 2019 and the calendar year 2020. Included in the rollout will be tailored transfer of learning opportunities and coaching to support staff with implementation and integration of the IPM into day to day practice, including how such practices apply in prevention services.

Appendix G contains more detail on how specific staff trainings will be modified to prepare staff for implementing Maryland’s Prevention Plan.

While there is significant alignment with the Prevention Plan, DHS/SSA will review and refine current training modules and practice frameworks throughout the Fall of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, to ensure the highest fidelity to the Prevention Plan. DHS/SSA will utilize its training framework to ensure that the workforce has the requisite skills to effectively and authentically engage and partner with youth and families, assess youth and families’ strengths and needs, and develop appropriate prevention focused service plans with youth and families to mitigate risk factors and promote safety, permanency and well-being.

# Section 8: Prevention Caseloads

Caseload size is an important factor to ensure effective case management for families and children receiving preventive services. Maryland has determined the prevention caseload sizes can be maintained at their current rates given that the candidates for prevention services will initially be limited to the population of children who receive In-Home Services and pregnant and parenting foster youth. Table 5 indicates the approximate staff-to-case ratios across the variety of program staff who will manage prevention services cases.

| Child Welfare Program                                               | Staff-to-Case Ratio\* |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Child Protective Services/Services to Families with Children-Intake | 1:12 families         |
| Family Preservation                                                 | 1:12 families         |
| Out-of-Home                                                         | 1:15 children         |

*Staff-to-case ratio is dependent on the level of services required to meet the assessed needs of each family/child.

Caseload ratios will be monitored and managed by local department child welfare supervisors and administrators. For families with higher needs, supervisors and case managers may determine a family could benefit from additional supportive services and assign a case associate to assist the case manager working with the family.

# Section 9: Assurance on Prevention Program Reporting

Appendix F contains DHS/SSA’s assurance as required by ACYF-CB-PI-18-09 Attachment I, that DHS/SSA will comply with all prevention program reporting requirements put forward by the Children’s Bureau. The Children’s Bureau reporting requirements to date are contained in the Title IV‐E Prevention Program Data Elements, Technical Bulletin #1, issued on August 19, 2019. Consistent with this guidance (or subsequent guidance), DHS/SSA will provide the following information for each child that receives Title IV-E prevention services:

- The service types provided to the child and/or family
- The total expenditures for each of the services provided to the child and/or family
- The duration of the services provided
- The child’s identification as a candidate or pregnant/parenting youth
- The child’s foster care status, as applicable prior to receiving services, and at 12 and 24 months after receiving services.
- Basic demographic information (e.g., age, sex, race/Hispanic or Latino ethnicity).

Appendix G: Maryland Staff Training Modifications to Align with the Prevention Plan

Listed below are the specific trainings that will be provided and/or modified as needed to prepare staff for implementing specific components of Maryland’s Prevention Plan:

# Identifying candidates and developing child-specific prevention plans

Knowledge of common characteristics of vulnerable children and families is fundamental to effective child welfare practice, treatment planning and intervention. Current pre-service training will be enhanced to include information on identifying candidates for Maryland’s prevention services as outlined in Section 2 of this plan as well as developing child-specific plans. The specific modules that will be modified include:

- Preservice Module 2 Indicators and Dynamics of Abuse and Neglect and Three Contributing Factors
- Foundation Track Training Series
- Introduction to CPS Responses (2 days)
- Introduction to Family Preservation
- Introduction to Placement and Permanency

For existing staff (caseworkers and supervisors), web-based trainings will be offered outlining the necessary changes required under Family First including identifying candidates and developing child-specific plans. In addition, planning is identified as a core practice of Maryland’s IPM. Through the roll out of the IPM, case workers and supervisors will be engaged in interactive training to build skills and competencies around developing child and family driven plans of care that will support the requirement of child-specific prevention plans under Family First.

# Conducting risk and safety assessments

New Child Welfare staff are currently trained to conduct risk and safety assessments as part of Preservice Module 4: Conducting Family Centered Assessments of Pre-Service. This module will be enhanced to support utilizing the risk assessment, SAFE-C, SDM, and CANS-F to inform the development of the child-specific prevention plan, including the identification of needs and appropriate evidence-based programs.

For existing staff, web-based trainings will be offered outlining the necessary changes required under Family First including conducting risk and safety assessments. In addition, conducting collaborative assessments is also identified as a core practice of Maryland’s Integrated Practice Model (IPM). Through the roll out of the IPM, case workers will be engaged in interactive training to build skills and competencies to engage in a collaborative assessment process to understand individual and family strengths, needs and family vision that will drive the collaborative partnership and the development of mutually agreed upon child-specific prevention plans.

# Engaging families in the assessment of strengths, needs, and the identification of appropriate services

For new Child Welfare staff Module 3: Engaging with Children and Families of pre-service teaches participants to explore effective techniques to engage and conduct interviews with children and families. Participants are provided opportunities to practice utilizing different types of questions and strategies based on situation, culminating in a mock interview videotaped session where they receive structured feedback from their peers. Additionally, participants learn about the process of change, strategies, strategies for working through anger, resistance and inertia, and ways to motivate families to improve service plans outcomes. This module will be enhanced to ensure alignment with engaging families in the assessing of strengths, needs, and the identification of services to assist with the development of child-specific prevention plans.

Authentic partnership and empowerment is a core principle of the IPM and the foundation on which the IPM was developed. Effective engagement is critical to building trust and respectful relationships with children and families receiving services. Engagement is an active process that serves as the foundation for individual and family healing and to building and maintaining strong relationships.

The IPM stresses that through relationship and partnership children, youth, families feel respected, empowered, included in all activities and decisions, and able to talk openly about their beliefs and experiences. This, in turn, leads to shared decision making and ownership of plans, which support sustainable outcomes.

As part of the IPM Child Welfare staff will be trained to authenticate partner with individual family members to understand their needs and strengths as well as how to use collaborative assessment to capture their experiences and identify services to meet their needs.

# Linking families with appropriate, trauma-informed, evidence-based services to mitigate risk and promote family stability and well-being

New and existing child welfare staff will be trained to link families with appropriate, trauma-informed, evidence-based services as outlined in section 3 of this plan. As part of the IPM, staff will be introduced to an evidence informed case planning process that will support staff in planning with the child and family creating a shared ownership of the plan. The planning process includes developing outcomes, understanding contributing factors, strategizing, and monitoring and evaluating progress. This training will also focus on workers partnering with the child and family to identify interventions designed to meet their specific needs. Finally, a discussion on identifying appropriate, trauma-informed, evidence-based services to mitigate risk and promote family stability and well-being will be incorporated in this training.

Current in-service training offered by CWA includes a number of courses related to trauma informed assessment and practice which will also be modified to support staff implementing Maryland’s Prevention Plan. DHS/SSA will review current coursework to ensure that there are ongoing opportunities to support staff in developing skills to effectively link families with

# Appropriate, Trauma-Informed, Evidence-Based Services

to mitigate risk and promote family stability and well-being.

# Oversight and Evaluation

of the continuing appropriateness of the services.

Pre-service course work for new child welfare staff includes a two-day Foundations course on Assessing and Planning for Risk and Safety. This module will be modified to assist staff in providing the needed oversight and evaluation of prevention plans and candidacy definitions to assess the ongoing need for prevention services are still needed.

As noted above the evidence informed case planning process being implemented as part of Maryland’s IPM includes a monitoring and evaluating progress approach to planning. Specifically, monitoring progress involves direct feedback from family as to whether they believe they are getting closer to their vision as a result of the Plan of Care, as well as if they are satisfied with coordinated services being provided, and if they believe their identified challenges are getting better. Included in this training are discussions related to ongoing review of service plans at regularly established timeframes (i.e. once a month).
