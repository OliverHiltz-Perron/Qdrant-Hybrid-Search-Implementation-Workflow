# Introduction

Over the past 13 years, the District of Columbia’s (DC) Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) has been on a journey of transformation, moving purposefully away from a system primarily focused on foster care to one that supports and strengthens families. CFSA’s investments in community-based prevention and our partnerships with sister health and human services agencies have been concomitant with a 74% reduction in the number of children and youth in foster care (see Figure 1), from 2,092 children in FY10 to 535 today, even as the city’s population has grown 15%, from about 602,000 to 689,545 residents according to the most recent Census.¹

Enactment of the Family First Prevention Services Act (Family First) provided an opportunity to bridge the end of CFSA’s IV-E Waiver demonstration project (Waiver) with an on-ramp to a holistic prevention strategy for DC – but only if coupled with a broader primary prevention plan. When CFSA launched its Family First Prevention Work Group in June 2018 with cross-sector representation from government and community members, the charge was clear: develop a citywide strategy to strengthen and stabilize families. The plan was not to be driven by Family First, but rather to leverage new opportunities provided by Family First as part of a comprehensive approach to family and child well-being.

This proposal to the Children’s Bureau represents CFSA’s five-year prevention plan in accordance with Family First, but it also describes it in the broader context of the District’s transformational shift from a child welfare system to a Child and Family Well-Being System. This plan builds on the substantial progress made over the past 13 years to bolster prevention efforts to reduce child abuse and neglect. This plan reinforces the successes garnered through the implementation of CFSA’s Waiver and capitalizes on the critical lessons learned to refine programs and services to better meet the needs of DC’s children, youth, and families.

# CFSA’s Plan

CFSA’s plan, outlined herein, remains in close alignment with the Children’s Bureau’s vision to keep families healthy, together, and strong2 and continues to build upon the primary prevention work outlined most by the Children’s Bureau in August of 20183 and more recently through the Thriving Families, Safer Children (TFSC) initiative.4 CFSA has remained resolute in focusing on our strategic framework developed in 2012, the Four Pillars5 (see Figure 2). The Four Pillars represent a path to improve outcomes for children, youth, and families at every step in their involvement with the District’s child welfare agency. Each pillar sits on a values-based foundation, a set of evidence-based strategies, and a series of specific outcome targets.

# The Four Pillars are:

- Front Door: The goal is to narrow the Front Door. Children deserve to grow up with their families and should be removed only as the last resort. When we must remove a child for safety, we seek to place with relatives first.
- Temporary Safe Haven: Foster care is a good interim place for children to live while we work to get them back to a permanent home as quickly as possible. Planning for a safe exit begins as soon as a child enters the system.
- Well-Being: Every child has a right to a nurturing environment that supports healthy growth and development, good physical and mental health, and academic achievement. Children should leave foster care better than when they entered.
- Exit to Permanence: Every child and youth exits foster care as quickly as possible for a safe, well-supported family environment or life-long connection. Older youth have the skills they need to succeed as adults.

As noted in Figure 2, CFSA’s Four Pillars framework includes the Front Door, Front Porch, and Front Yard as a continuum of service interventions designed to meet families’ needs and prevent child abuse and neglect across the child welfare system.

• Families in CFSA’s Front Yard are not involved with CFSA but may demonstrate potential risk factors for involvement. Primary prevention efforts are designed to ensure children and families in CFSA’s Front Yard are supported in their communities.

• Families at CFSA’s Front Porch may have engaged with CFSA, but have been able to safely remain, or reunify, with their families and receive community-based prevention services offered by our partnership with DC’s Healthy Families/Thriving Communities Collaboratives partners (Collaboratives).⁶

• Families engaged at CFSA’s Front Door have an open case with CFSA. Whenever possible, CFSA prioritizes keeping families together and working with parents and children in their communities.

DC’s long-standing and continued commitment to primary prevention, family stabilization, and values-based practices are reflected throughout this plan and highlight CFSA’s progressive focus on building a 21st century child welfare system.

# The Shift from Waiver to Family First

CFSA’s Title IV-E Waiver, implemented from FY14-FY19, was designed to be responsive to the changing needs of children and families as DC experienced a decline in the number of foster-care placements and an increase in the number of children able to remain safely and stably at-home in their communities. At the time of implementation, CFSA theorized that by enhancing services and supports to children and families at various levels of involvement with the child welfare system, more children and youth would remain safely and stably in their homes, and for those children who were removed for safety concerns, a greater number of children would be able to achieve timely permanence. Progress to date has been incremental and trends towards consistently positive outcomes for families.⁷ Using continuous quality improvement cycles, CFSA was able to make decisions, informed by evidence and data, regarding Waiver programs. Evaluation reports showed that outcomes were better for families involved in Waiver programs; however, these programs served a small set of families and consistently failed to reach their target enrollment numbers. Through the evaluation findings and experiences with the Waiver, CFSA has gained an understanding of the kind of programs that families will use and see to completion. With the no-cost extension of the Waiver through September 30th, 2019,⁸ CFSA continued to implement the evidence-based service.

6 For over 20 years, the Healthy Families/Thriving Communities Collaboratives have been key partners to CFSA, serving as community-based prevention service providers. The Collaboratives provide an array of essential core services, including case management, information resource, referral, and linkage, as well as specialized services such as parent education and support programming to meet the needs of both CFSA-involved and all District Families.

interventions that work well for DC’s community to strengthen families and address the well-being of both children and their parents.

As CFSA moved from the implementation of the Waiver to Family First, the Agency made IV-E funding available for a subset of the families (Family First candidates and pregnant or parenting youth in foster care, collectively referred to as Family First prevention-eligible children) previously served under the Waiver. For these children, CFSA worked to deepen partnerships with service providers and sister agency partners to leverage existing capacity where current services were working well for families. CFSA also created new investments in service interventions required to meet the specific needs of DC’s Family First prevention-eligible children. Family First prevention plan services are currently targeted to Family First prevention-eligible children known to CFSA’s “Front Door” and “Front Porch,” providing secondary and tertiary services to meet the needs of families that have had contact with CFSA. At the time of this plan amendment, CFSA intends to make Family First prevention plan services available to children and their families experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness in the “Front Yard” (see Section 1 for an updated description of CFSA’s target populations and candidate definition).

# Families First DC: A Critical Step Toward Primary Prevention

DC has embraced a family strengthening vision that is broader and bolder than Family First, and Mayor Muriel Bowser has reinforced that vision with a companion initiative: Families First DC (FFDC). In her FY20 budget, the Mayor provided $4.75 million to fund ten Family Success Centers (FSC) in targeted neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River, where approximately three-quarters of the children and families served by CFSA live.⁹ CFSA has since leveraged additional federal funding through the American Rescue Plan Act’s CAPTA and CBCAP allocations to expand Families First DC west of the Anacostia River where many families and communities who interact with CFSA also live. These additional funds resulted in the opening of a new Family Success Center in Ward 5 in FY22.

While CFSA’s prevention plan, detailed in the following pages, originally focused on the array of secondary and tertiary prevention services available to support Family First prevention-eligible children and caregivers, the District is also working to build family-strengthening supports upstream. The goal of FFDC is to create a network of primary prevention services and neighborhood-driven resources to round-out DC’s robust secondary and tertiary city-wide prevention strategy (see Figure 3). Families First DC was a direct outgrowth of the planning conducted to be ready for implementation of the Family First Prevention Services Act in 2019. It is a neighborhood-based, whole

9 All ten neighborhoods are located in Wards 7 and 8. Data analysis was conducted to select these neighborhoods based on social determinants of health, violence prevention priority areas, and substantiated reports of child abuse and neglect.

# Families First DC

Family approach for vulnerable families who live in DC. Families First DC is designed to disrupt the way services are delivered in neighborhoods where barriers to well-being, economic opportunity, and achievement are most acute. FFDC is one of the key front yard strategies to support families in their communities.

# Goals of Families First DC

- Empower Communities – through a place-based approach, neighborhoods and families will envision and create Family Success Centers that will meet their specific needs. Community Advisory Committees will be established, neighborhood action planning will be employed, and strategically tailored community-based grants will be provided to fill services gaps to meet their communities’ needs.
- Integrate Services – the Family Success Centers will be uniquely designed by each community to facilitate access to existing government resources and new initiatives tailored to meet families’ needs.
- Focus Upstream – The Family Success Centers will focus on increasing protective factors10 and mitigating trauma to build on community and family strengths. Services will be designed to prevent crises through early engagement, offer assistance to meet families’ basic needs, respond flexibly to the needs of families and the communities, and provide services outside of a traditional office setting.

Launched in October 2020, FFDC now offers community-driven supportive services and resources to families in Wards 5, 7, and 8. The FSCs have been intentional in their commitment to community leadership throughout the implementation process, from recruitment to site selection to decision-making around programming and funding. FSCs support families in navigating resources and services that are already available in their neighborhoods and beyond, either through government agencies or community-based organizations, and then identifying and providing any gaps in resources. The resources provided vary from site to site, based on each neighborhood’s needs, but often include some or all the following services:

- Computer literacy and professional development
- Counseling and wellness programs
- Diaper bank/food pantry
- Financial education
- Healthcare services
- Housing support
- Multigenerational programs

# Parental support and parenting workshops

- Self-care, individual coaching, and support groups
- Youth development programs

In FY21, the Family Success Centers reported that they collectively served 16,038 families, thereby making the Families First DC initiative one of the most far-reaching primary prevention efforts ever conducted by CFSA’s community-based partners.11 Since inception, the FSCs have also generated 23,174 service referrals using CFSA’s third-party platform, Unite Us, including 2,143 referrals to housing search assistance and income-based housing services, 1,226 referrals to food pantry services, and 903 referrals for job search assistance.

Building upon the successful implementation of the Families First DC initiative, CFSA joined the Thriving Families, Safer Children (TFSC): A National Commitment to Well-being initiative in FY21. The TFSC movement now includes child welfare sites in 22 states, is supported by the U.S. Children’s Bureau, the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and organizations including Casey Family Programs, Prevent Child Abuse America (PCA America), and the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Its nationwide goal is to create a more just and equitable Child and Family Well-Being System.12

As a TFSC Round 2 jurisdiction, CFSA is committed to putting forward innovative solutions aimed at Keeping DC Families Together (KDCFT). KDCFT is the District’s TFSC effort to make a transformational shift from child welfare to child and family well-being. In close collaboration with people with lived experience and community-based organizations, CFSA is assessing mandated reporting laws, reasons for hotline calls, and the creation of a warmline to offset unnecessary calls to the child welfare agency. Work under TFSC also includes the establishment of a District-wide community response model. These efforts have the intent to shift more referrals and supports into the community as the first response (Front Yard) and proportionally reduce the number of Front Porch and Front Door cases (CFSA involved) over time by meeting children and families’ needs before challenges become crises and risk becomes safety concerns.

As KDCFT unfolds its tapestry of community-grounded primary prevention supports, CFSA proposes the following amendment to our approved Family First prevention plan as a complement to this larger effort by partnering with our sister government agencies and community-based organizations responsible for serving the most vulnerable and at-risk populations of children and families through evidence-based services to prevent foster care entry. The two initiatives align and intersect without overlapping, providing a comprehensive approach to preventing child maltreatment in the nation’s capital.

# Section 1: Target population (Child and Family Eligibility for Title IV-E Prevention Program)

# Overview of Target Population

CFSA’s target population for prevention services under Family First comprises sub-populations of children at risk of entry into foster care and their caregivers. These sub-populations were selected and approved by CFSA’s Family First Prevention Work Group (Work Group), now known as the KDCFT Steering Committee, as the target population for Family First prevention services in light of each group’s (1) high rates of foster care entry or re-entry in the past calendar year and (2) high assessed levels of risk according to CFSA’s Structured Decision Making (SDM) tool, CFSA’s validated risk assessment tool, in the past calendar year and/or (3) particular needs or characteristics that, if unaddressed through prevention services, ultimately may result in CFSA involvement.¹³ Where available, additional research evidence and data were examined to form a deeper understanding of each sub-population’s risk of foster care entry. Careful application of these criteria has ensured that the children most at risk of imminent foster care entry will be targeted. These sub-populations will be discussed as two distinct cohorts: A) Front Yard – “Community Pathway” or B) Front Porch and Front Door – “Known-to-CFSA.”

# Front Yard – “Community Pathway”

In alignment with other states, such as Connecticut, CFSA is committed to “extend prevention services to families with identified children experiencing behaviors, conditions, or circumstances that are likely to have adverse impacts on a child’s development or functioning, but do not present immediate safety concerns.”¹⁴ In order to accomplish this goal, using the unique infrastructure already available in the District, CFSA intends to extend the target population for prevention services under Family First to include evidence-based case management services using Motivational Interviewing (MI) for families served by other District government agencies in the Front Yard. This amendment seeks to add one specific DC Government agency partnership and related population: children and their families who have been determined eligible for homeless services (currently experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness) by the Department of Human Services’ Virginia Williams Family Resource Center (VWFRC).

Empirical studies have shown that substandard housing poses a significant risk to family stability in communities throughout the United States.15,16,¹⁷ An expanding body of literature also highlights the

impact of housing insecurity on child development and family well-being. In contrast to stably housed low-income families, studies have shown that families experiencing housing instability are at an elevated risk of being subject to investigation by the child welfare system. Families facing housing instability are also at a heightened risk of child separation. The presence of housing instability is linked to reduced rates of family reunification, which in turn can result in children spending extended periods in out-of-home placement, as evidenced by previous research. These disparities contribute to the high incidence of child welfare involvement among families confronting housing instability. For instance, a 2004 study of homeless children in New York City revealed that a substantial proportion received child welfare services, with risk factors such as recurrent shelter use, exposure to domestic violence, older age at initial homelessness, and larger family sizes indicating the need for coordinated services for this vulnerable population.

Issue briefs have indicated that increased coordination between child welfare systems and housing and homeless services continuums of care are necessary to ensure that families are provided with the most appropriate support. Additionally, there has been a call to action to identify “evidence-based interventions that promote family preservation or reunification and housing stability among homeless or precariously housed families.” Updates to this plan are designed to address this important need and fortify the collaboration between child welfare and homeless services agencies in the District to support children and their families.

To support this new primary prevention target population, CFSA has partnered with the District’s Department of Human Services (DHS) to identify prevention-eligible children and their families. This population is defined in this plan as families who have been determined eligible for homeless services by the District’s central family intake center for homeless services: The Virginia Williams Family Resource Center (VWFRC). Families are determined eligible for homeless services by VWFRC intake staff if they.

are experiencing or at risk of homelessness as defined by the District’s Homeless Services Reform Act of 2005.²⁹ These families can access a wide range of preventive and emergency housing services offered by DHS, including emergency rental assistance, temporary emergency shelter, rapid re-housing, among others.³⁰ DHS staff and contracted community-based providers offer case management services to families deemed eligible for homeless services to help support them while in shelter or other housing programs, and help connect them to additional housing resources, public benefits, physical and behavioral healthcare, harm reduction initiatives, and an array of additional supportive services.

While the majority of families entering VWFRC do not have an open CFSA case at the time of entry, research and empirical evidence supports that many families accessing homeless services have underlying needs, compounded by the challenges, limited resources, and stress associated with temporary or unstable living conditions, that, if unaddressed, increase the likelihood of child welfare agency involvement.³¹

With this plan amendment, CFSA seeks the opportunity to better support eligible District families experiencing homelessness or at risk of experiencing homelessness by enhancing DHS’s case management activities to include Motivational Interviewing (MI), which has been shown to be effective at reducing risk factors for populations experiencing homelessness.³² For families determined eligible for homeless services who do not currently have an open CFSA case, the assumption is that by enhancing services for these families, more children and youth will remain safely in their homes, and for those who are removed for safety concerns, a greater number will be able to achieve timely permanence.

For prevention-eligible children and their families experiencing or at risk of homelessness, MI-based case management services will be claimable under Title IV-E. CFSA and DHS will utilize a Memorandum of Understanding to leverage Title IV-E funds to address the needs of these children and their families.

# Front Porch and Front Door – “Known-to-CFSA”

Front Porch and Front Door families have come to the attention of CFSA via a call to the District’s Child Protective Services (CPS) Hotline. While these children and their families are “Known to CFSA,” prevention services can be put in place to safely prevent foster care entry or re-entry.

- Front Porch families represent children and their families served in their communities, specifically by the Collaboratives. These children and their families have had either an open investigation or case with CFSA but based on investigation/case and risk assessment outcomes, are now able to be stepped down to prevention services in their communities.
- Front Door families represent children and their families, as well as pregnant or parenting youth and their children, who have an open case with the Agency, but these children remain in the home, and can be provided preventative services from CFSA’s social work teams.

# How CFSA Will Assess Children and Their Parents or Kin Caregivers to Determine Eligibility for Family First Prevention Services

Front Porch and Front Door – “Known to CFSA”

Children and their families in CFSA’s Front Porch and Front Door will be determined eligible for Title IV-E prevention services based on the investigation outcome and the results of the SDM tool (CFSA’s formal risk assessment tool) conducted during an investigation or open CFSA case. For families falling within the Front Door and Front Porch categories, a Family First Eligibility Screen and Child-Specific Prevention.

33 Each sub-population is categorized within the intervention group they belong to at the start of their candidacy. Note that individuals within each subgroup could move into different intervention groups during the course of their candidacy.

34 Children in this subgroup can be determined eligible for services via a Prevention Plan at various times relative to their child welfare involvement, e.g., immediately upon permanency or later when the family returns to CFSA’s attention.

DC CFSA | Putting Families First in DC | December 22, 2023

Plan will be completed by CFSA staff for each Family First prevention-eligible child if appropriate to establish that they are eligible for IV-E-supported prevention services under Family First, and to articulate an associated foster care prevention strategy. Only CFSA staff will determine child-specific eligibility for prevention services. To ensure that CFSA workers correctly identify children who are Family First prevention-eligible, an eligibility screen has been designed in FACES, CFSA’s system of record, to confirm the child’s membership in one of the above-noted subgroups, which reflect imminent risk of entering foster care. The technical interface guides the appropriate CFSA worker through development of a foster care prevention strategy and selection of associated EBP interventions.

Family First prevention-eligible children may or may not be substantiated as maltreated, but all instances where investigation findings are “unfounded” or “inconclusive,” the SDM result will be assessed as either “high” or “intensive” to be considered at imminent risk of entering foster care. In instances where maltreatment has been substantiated, children and their caregivers will be considered eligible for prevention services, regardless of the SDM result. CFSA includes these children and their families in our definition of imminent risk, regardless of SDM result, because the investigation concluded that there is, presently, a substantiated allegation of abuse or neglect. CFSA considers these children and their families to be at imminent risk for foster care entry.

# Front Yard – “Community Pathway”

Front Yard children and their families will be determined eligible for Title IV-E prevention services based on information gathered during DHS’s intake and eligibility determination process for homeless services, as outlined in DC’s Homeless Services Reform Act of 2005 (HSRA)/2017 amendments).35 The Virginia Williams Family Resource Center (VWFRC) serves as DHS’s central intake center for homeless families where the homeless services eligibility determination process takes place.36 For children and their families experiencing or at risk of homelessness, the VWFRC’s assessment and subsequent determination of eligibility for homeless services equates to CFSA’s determination of imminent risk for foster care entry.

For Front Yard families, data on family eligibility is captured during the VWFRC intake and assessment process and captured in DHS’s homeless services system of record: the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS). VWFRC intake staff gather information relevant to determining eligibility via an assessment process guided by the Family Assessment Mapping (FAM) form. Through the FAM form, VWFRC staff collect information about a family’s housing barriers and history, income and benefits, disability, and children’s education. VWFRC staff utilize the FAM form to guide their conversations and interview process with the family in order to gather all relevant details required to determine homeless services eligibility. This assessment process includes determining District residency and may also involve contacting family members, friends, and other contacts who have previously housed/sheltered the family, or who may be able to in the future, and discuss options to secure a safe, stable housing situation for the family. VWFRC works with the family to comprehensively assess options to prevent.

homelessness, while also connecting them to other needed social services and public benefits. If no other long-term options are viable for safe, stable housing, and the head of household is a resident of the District of Columbia, then a family is determined eligible for homeless services.

The FAM form and assessment process are completed for all families seeking homeless services from the VWFRC. Because the homeless services eligibility determination process and outcomes are captured in HMIS, there is sufficient information available via HMIS to determine child-specific eligibility for Title IV-E prevention services under Family First. Only CFSA staff will determine child-specific eligibility for prevention services. A Memorandum of Agreement will be established between CFSA and DHS to ensure CFSA staff are notified of and have access to the homeless services eligibility outcomes in HMIS to determine child eligibility for Title IV-E prevention services. To ensure the CFSA Prevention Specialist (DHS Liaison) correctly identifies children who are Family First prevention-eligible, new screens will be created in HMIS to confirm the child’s membership in the above-noted community pathway candidate subgroup, which reflects imminent risk of entering foster care. The HMIS technical interface will support the appropriate DHS or CBO provider staff through the development of a foster care prevention strategy and selection of associated EBP interventions (primarily Motivational Interviewing).

# Process for Establishing Candidacy Date and Inclusion in a Child-Specific Prevention Plan

For Front Door and Front Porch families, CFSA staff responsible for determining eligibility select from a series of fields that include questions and answers in FACES to document child-specific eligibility for prevention services. The selection of eligibility-related fields in FACES not only validates eligibility but also provides a child-specific candidacy timestamp also known as “candidacy determination date” for the candidate child or youth, and their family.

For Front Yard families, the DHS Liaison will document child-specific eligibility for prevention services in HMIS. Confirmation of eligibility by the DHS Liaison will yield a timestamp indicating a “candidacy determination date.”

In all instances, this timestamp will be used to determine the 12-month time limit and will be monitored and tracked electronically. Collaborative and DHS staff and CBO providers will not be responsible for determining eligibility for prevention services but will be responsible for managing prevention plans for prevention-eligible children and their families when candidacy has been established by CFSA. Technical solutions in FACES, the Community Portal (Front Porch and Front Door families), and HMIS (Front Yard families) are designed to provide the necessary data exchanges between CFSA, the Collaboratives, and DHS to meet this stated business process. Each subsequent 12-month prevention plan period will be determined by CFSA Prevention Specialist staff upon the request of the CFSA, Collaborative, DHS, or DHS’s CBO provider staff.

# Process for Prevention Services Determination

For Front Porch and Front Door families, the FACES interfaces allow workers to view risk and comprehensive assessment results while developing the Child-Specific Prevention Plan, thus enabling CFSA workers to reference and draw on assessment results and investigation outcomes when.

DC CFSA | Putting Families First in DC | December 22, 2023

Determining eligibility, developing the foster care prevention strategy, and selecting appropriate services. CFSA workers responsible for completing a child’s Prevention Plan are trained in understanding SDM assessment and investigation results to inform an eligibility determination and service selection. Likewise, for Front Yard families, DHS staff and CBO providers will utilize the information from the FAM form assessment results to inform the development of the foster care prevention strategies and selection of appropriate services for Front Yard children and their families. DHS staff and CBO providers will additionally utilize informal child welfare risk assessment and results from applicable homeless services assessments including the FAM form, the Westat Assessment for homeless prevention program sites, and the Family Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool (F-SPDAT) to comprehensively assess a family’s needs, offer support in navigating housing barriers, and facilitate connections to appropriate resources for mental health, substance abuse, domestic violence, and other identified needs. In addition, DHS staff and providers responsible for completing a child’s Prevention Plan will receive training from CFSA on how to identify evidence-based services and family and community supports and utilize community services referral technology to ensure the selection of the best possible services for each family.

The results from these assessments will be used by CFSA to determine eligibility for prevention services annually, should there be a need for services beyond twelve (12) months or if there has been a change in identified risk. Families who are determined eligible for homeless services beyond 12 months by DHS will be considered eligible for Family First prevention services. CFSA will use management reports as well as the support of DHS staff and staff within CFSA’s prevention unit to ensure claiming ceases when a child is determined to no longer be a candidate prior to the 12-month time limit.

# Child-Specific Prevention Plan Completion and Storage

For Front Porch and Front Door families, the Child-Specific Prevention Plan template is linked within the existing in-home services case plans, foster care case plans, intervention plans, and sustainability plans in CFSA’s child welfare information system, FACES. For Front Yard families, the Child-Specific Prevention Plan template will be linked within the existing intake and case management service screens in HMIS. Integration within existing technology solutions allows CFSA to streamline case documentation and ensure that each child-specific Prevention Plan aligns with larger case and service planning efforts. If the need for a foster care prevention strategy and associated services becomes necessary in the life of any case that falls within the Family First prevention-eligible candidate populations, or when a youth in foster care who is pregnant or parenting is identified, a Prevention Plan is created to confirm the child’s eligibility and document service needs.

37 The Westat Assessment is an information gathering tool administered every 90 days at homeless prevention program sites to assess eligibility for homeless services and inform service provision.

38 F-SPDAT is an evidence-informed approach to assessing a family’s acuity. The tool, across multiple components, prioritizes who to serve next and why, while concurrently identifying the areas in the person or family’s life where support is most likely necessary in order to avoid housing instability. The F-SPDAT is conducted at program entry and at least every 90 days to document qualifying events (including incidence of domestic violence, change in medical condition, birth of a child, etc.).

DC CFSA | Putting Families First in DC | December 22, 2023

The Child-Specific Prevention Plan will always be completed and (if needed) edited by CFSA staff or CFSA’s community-based contracted Collaborative partners, or designated DHS/CBO provider personnel. In situations where a child eligible for Family First prevention services has a CFSA in-home or foster care caseworker, that caseworker completes the Prevention Plan as part of the case planning process. For families referred directly from investigations to the Collaboratives, who do not have CFSA caseworkers, CFSA’s Collaborative partners complete the Prevention Plan. Likewise, for families served by DHS who do not have CFSA case workers, following CFSA’s eligibility determination, designated DHS personnel or their CBO providers will complete the Prevention Plan.

# Collaborative Case Transfer Process for Front Porch and Front Door Cases – “Known to CFSA”

When a referral (if following a closed investigation) or case (following an open In-Home or Out-of-Home case) is ready to be transferred to a Collaborative for case management services and ongoing Prevention Plan management, the FACES technology allows a CFSA staff person to initiate CFSA’s electronic “Case Transfer Process.” The Case Transfer Process allows CFSA staff to transition the referral or case, including the Prevention Plan, to the appropriate Collaborative based on geography and service needs of the prevention-eligible children and their family. All relevant information related to the prevention-eligible child and their family is transferred electronically to the specified Collaborative. The candidacy determination date and “eligibility clock” are visible through the CFSA Community Portal (Community Portal). The Community Portal is the technical interface the Collaboratives use to accept all referrals/cases transferred from CFSA to the Collaboratives for ongoing case management and prevention plan management. The Collaboratives are able to view the candidacy determination date and “eligibility clock” when reviewing or updating a prevention plan.

# Child-Specific Prevention Plan Maintenance by the Collaboratives

CFSA developed a web-based Community Portal (technical solution) which allows CFSA staff to transfer a Prevention Plan to the appropriate Collaborative as part of the Case Transfer Process. After the case is successfully transferred, the Collaborative is able to view relevant assessment data on the prevention-eligible child and their family, as well as view and update the prevention plan as needed to reflect current service needs. The Collaborative is not able to edit the original candidacy determination (eligibility timestamp) but is able to re-assess risk based on changes to the child/family’s situation and needs. The Collaboratives report to CFSA in real-time if the child/family is no longer participating in services. CFSA staff have full access to the Community Portal to review cases.

# Collaborative Oversight

Oversight is provided as part of contract management performed by CFSA’s Office of Thriving Families/Community Partnerships Administration program staff (Prevention Specialists) and CFSA Contract Monitoring Divisions’ contract monitors. CFSA uses real-time management reports, monthly and quarterly data analyses, and quarterly case-record reviews performed by the contract monitors to oversee the Collaboratives' performance and ensure quality service delivery to children and families. The Collaboratives are required, as part of their contracts, to maintain fidelity with evidence-based model standards and have dedicated staff to perform internal quality assurance checks.

# Child-Specific Prevention Plan Maintenance by DHS and Their Contracted Providers

CFSA will work with DHS and its contractors to further develop HMIS to allow DHS staff and CBO providers to manage Prevention Plans in the community. After eligibility has been determined for Family First prevention services by a CFSA Prevention Specialist (DHS Liaison), Prevention Plan management and maintenance will reside with the specific homeless services continuum of care case management provider designated by DHS. This may be a DHS employee or one of their designated CBO homeless services/housing case management providers. The DHS or CBO staff will be able to view relevant assessment data on the prevention-eligible child and their family, as well as view and update the Prevention Plan as needed to reflect current service needs. The DHS or CBO staff are not able to edit the original candidacy determination (eligibility timestamp) but are able to re-assess risk based on changes to the child/family’s situation and needs. The DHS or CBO staff will centrally report to CFSA, via the DHS Liaison, in real-time if the child/family is no longer participating in services. The DHS Liaison will have targeted access to HMIS to view only the necessary details to adhere to Title IV-E eligibility, monitoring, and reporting requirements.

# DHS Oversight

Oversight will be provided as part of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between DHS and CFSA. Related requirements will be written into DHS’s CBO’s contracts/agreements. CFSA Office of Thriving Families/Community Partnerships Administration program staff (Prevention Specialists) will use real-time management reports, monthly and quarterly data analyses, and quarterly case-record reviews to oversee DHS and CBO performance and ensure quality service delivery to children and families. DHS and their CBOs will be required, as part of the MOU and related contracts/agreements, to maintain fidelity with evidence-based model standards and have dedicated staff to perform internal quality assurance checks. In addition to regular MOU/agreement oversight, CFSA monitors CQI activities as part of CFSA’s evaluation design. The requirements of the Prevention Plan and all aspects of the Prevention Plan management and ongoing risk assessment will be written into the DHS MOU and subsequent DHS CBO contract/agreement requirements. The CFSA Prevention Specialist (DHS Liaison) will be responsible for ensuring these requirements are met in alignment with all Title IV-E Family First Prevention Plan requirements.

Pre - print Sections 1 and 4

# The Backdrop: Lessons Learned through CFSA’s Waiver

Through the implementation of the Waiver, CFSA learned important lessons that have strongly influenced the development of this five-year plan, and specifically, the selection of evidence-based program (EBP) services included herein. Namely, CFSA learned that:

- Narrow inclusionary/exclusionary requirements of nationally recognized EBP models led to low rates of referral acceptance in DC’s local implementation. Moreover, different EBPs work well for different families, as family preferences regarding program intensity, format, and focus vary. Consequently, it is essential to maintain an array of EBPs that is as diverse as the families served to ensure that each family can be matched to EBPs that align with their needs and circumstances.
- Families often struggle to take up and sustain participation in EBPs due to a variety of barriers. Families are more likely to initiate EBP participation if actively supported by a skilled and engaged caseworker that supports the family in overcoming psychological, logistical, and other barriers.
- Successful EBP implementation and program sustainability require diligent attention to business processes and continuous quality improvements. These processes must be planned carefully and monitored through CQI and evaluation, as will be discussed in Section 4 below.

To select the EBPs outlined in this five-year plan, CFSA staff and stakeholders closely assessed not only each program’s level of research evidence, but also the target populations, eligibility criteria, and time-intensity of each intervention to ensure the available service array includes the best-fit services for greatest number of families within the identified target populations.

# Rationale for Service Selection

CFSA drew on diverse evidence as well as a robust stakeholder engagement process to drive data-centered and locally informed decisions around the most appropriate evidence-based services to support the District’s Family First prevention-eligible children and their caregivers to reduce risk factors and increase protective factors for child abuse and neglect. Services were explored and selected by the District of Columbia Family First Prevention Work Group (Work Group), which met for over six months and comprised diverse CFSA staff and external stakeholders from key community organizations and sister agencies (see Stakeholder Engagement in Target Population and EBP Service Selection below for additional details). The Work Group prioritized three broad criteria in selecting each service: (1) Identifying a service array that aligns with the characteristics and service needs of target families, thus ensuring that each family will be able to secure a service that meets their specific needs and circumstances, (2) Ensuring each service identified has a high level of evidence of effectiveness—not only from national evaluations, but also drawing on data and experiences with

DC CFSA | Putting Families First in DC | December 22, 2023

---

DC CFSA | Putting Families First in DC | December 22, 2023
these very programs as implemented in DC, and (3) Prioritizing selecting services that currently are in place and successful within DC, building on existing capacity, model familiarity, and effectiveness.

Upon expanding CFSA’s target population to include families experiencing or at risk of homelessness, CFSA and DHS collectively determined that Motivational Interviewing (MI) would be an appropriate intervention to be used throughout DHS’s already existing assessment tools and Case Management activities. To follow is an overview of how data and evidence were used to inform selection in accordance with each of these criteria.

# (1) Identifying a service array that aligns with the characteristics and service needs of targeted families.

Building upon the lessons learned from the Waiver described above, CFSA selected an array of EBPs in the domains of in-home parent skill-based programs, mental health, and substance abuse prevention and treatment services selected specifically to meet the needs of Family First prevention-eligible children and their caregivers. To gain an understanding of the needs of these children and families, CFSA conducted extensive analyses, including considering the following data and evidence to inform a deep understanding of the range and nature of service needs of Family First prevention-eligible children and their caregivers.

- Child and family demographic data derived from FACES, including but not limited to child age, parent age, and family size, which are among the top eligibility criteria for each EBP under consideration.
- Case characteristic data derived from FACES, including removal reasons and maltreatment indices, which illustrate patterns family risks and needs.
- Child and family assessment data, including aggregate results from CFSA’s comprehensive assessments: the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale (CAFAS), Preschool and Early Childhood Functional Assessment Scale (PECFAS), and the Caregiver Strengths and Barriers Assessment (CSBA). These results paint a rich picture of child and family strengths and needs.
- Input from subject matter experts and stakeholders who work directly with or administer programs for the target population, to answer questions not addressed by data sources listed above and to make recommendations based on first-hand experience regarding necessary components of the preventive services array.
- Sister agency data analyses describing the service needs of the families they serve who also have CFSA involvement.
- Two focus groups with families who have both engaged or disengaged in evidence-based services across the District. The conversations yielded an understanding not only of family service needs broadly but also the characteristics of services that tend to work best, barriers to services, and characteristics of case managers that can support and promote service participation.
- A focus group with service providers provided insights about barriers to services and perceptions as to which EBPs have worked best for families locally.
- DC’s Title IV-E Waiver preliminary evaluation, providing insights and lessons-learned about the implementation and effectiveness of Waiver-funded EBPs.

# Evaluation of CFSA’s Initiative to Improve Access to Needs-Driven, Evidence-Based/Informed Mental and Behavioral Health Services in Child Welfare

trauma grant, including information about CFSA’s experiences completing extensive workforce training on trauma, implementing trauma-sensitive assessment tools, and engaging in data-driven case planning and monitoring. Taken together these data clearly illustrate the characteristics and service needs of Family First prevention-eligible children and their caregivers. Following synthesis, meaning making, and discussion within the Work Group, these data directly informed the specific array of preventive services proposed herein. This process produced a broad proposed array of services, none of which are duplicative. Each EBP serves a different target population, operates with different format or intensity, and/or is designed to produce different outcomes, thus aligning with the diverse identified needs and characteristics of the children and families in the target population.

# (2) Ensuring each service identified has a high level of evidence of effectiveness.

As the Work Group explored and defined the service needs of families in DC, it became apparent that the 12 programs under initial review on the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse were not sufficient alone to meet the needs of the families CFSA serves. Therefore, CFSA developed a proposed service array that demonstrates a high level of evidence according to the ratings of the California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare (CEBC)39 and estimated ratings based on the criteria defined in the legislation that will be used by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse. Ratings likely to be produced by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse were estimated based on a close review of research evidence associated with each program within the District’s proposed service array relative to criteria for ratings clearly described in PI 18-09, Attachment C.40 Using these methods, CFSA has closely considered the evidence associated with each program and determined that the proposed service array reflects a mix of programs likely to be rated as promising, supported, and well-supported in accordance with the requirements of the legislation, including projections indicating that over 50% of claiming will be for well-supported programs.

# (3) Prioritizing selecting services that currently are in place and effective within the District, building on existing capacity, model familiarity, and effectiveness.

DC maintains an unusually broad array of social services available to residents through the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH), Department of Human Services (DHS), DC Health, and numerous other agency and community-based providers. The Work Group and CFSA obtained extensive information about existing services to assess the supply of existing services relative to the estimated demand from Family First prevention-eligible children and their caregivers, including the following:

- A prevention services survey completed by all Work Group stakeholder organizations to capture information on existing mental health, substance abuse, and in-home parenting EBPs, as well as

key information about each. The survey was designed to help CFSA and stakeholders gain a holistic understanding of the breadth of existing services and the depth of capacity already within the District.

- Collaborative and sister agency presentations to the Prevention Work Group, including key health and human services agency stakeholders and DC’s Department of Employment Services to gather additional information about EBPs and other prevention activities already in place in the District.
- In-depth information and data gathering about existing EBP models, current capacity and utilization, staffing, effectiveness, and cost.

Collected evidence indicated that an impressive array of in-home parenting, mental health, and substance abuse treatment EBPs exists in DC. All selected services have existing capacity within DC. The Work Group determined that leveraging existing capacity, where programs are currently meeting the needs of families within the community, will allow CFSA to realize proximal outcomes (see Theory of Change in Section 4) for families while continuing to assess program efficacy and refine the best set of programs to meet the candidate populations’ needs over time. By selecting existing service interventions currently offered within the community, CFSA is ensuring the ability to effectuate this plan while minimizing time and energy to start-up new services.

# Services For Families Experiencing or at Risk of Homelessness

What began as an important population for CFSA’s Title IV-E Waiver, data has supported that families comprised of young parents (ages 18-25) with young children (ages 0-6) have been a consistent target population for evidence-based and evidence-informed services to prevent child abuse and neglect. Since 2017, CFSA and DC’s Department of Human Services (DHS) have partnered together to offer Collaborative case management services to this population of young families experiencing or at risk of homelessness in the District, while also connecting them to longer-term case management supports provided by DHS. While this collaboration has been seen as an important primary prevention strategy, over the past four years of implementation we have seen these community-based case management services go underutilized.

We’ve learned from this partnership that case management services are extremely valuable, but expecting families to show up for, and coordinate services amongst multiple providers, while in the midst of a housing crisis put unnecessary burden on families. Social services should make families lives easier, not harder. Moving to a model by which Title IV-E prevention services are available to families experiencing or at risk of homelessness without duplicating case management services and supports will be a crucial step to supporting families, in their communities, and reduce the burden government services often create for families navigating multiple social-safety net services and poverty reduction strategies. Offering Motivational Interviewing based case management to all families experiencing or at risk of homelessness, as part of their single case management plan, will be an extremely valuable step in the direction of preventing child abuse and neglect by meeting families’ needs, through existing services, before risks can become safety concerns.

# Implementation Approach

As described in the sections above, CFSA has developed strong partnerships with our health and human services sister agencies and community-based service providers to offer an array of parenting, mental health, and substance use treatment services to families currently involved with CFSA and more broadly to vulnerable populations across the District. CFSA’s comprehensive approach to preventing child maltreatment and strengthening families is embedded deeply in the fabric of the Agency and threaded throughout our evolving child welfare system as we move to create our Child and Family Well-Being System.

The efforts undertaken to identify a comprehensive service array for prevention-eligible children and their families has produced a roadmap for possible services to be claimed under Family First as part of CFSA’s five-year Prevention Plan. As CFSA’s Family First implementation began in 2019, CFSA has leveraged existing partnerships and evidence-based program capacity to serve candidate children and their families. Of the services currently deemed allowable by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse, many outlined below in CFSA’s proposed service array have existing capacity in the District and are funded through other federal sources (Medicaid and the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program; MIECHV).

Due to the existing federal funding mechanisms in place to support the existing service capacity, at the time of this submission, CFSA is using local dollars to support adding capacity to one of the allowable evidence-based programs, the Parents As Teachers (PAT) model, outlined in the proposed service array below. CFSA conducts State-level CQI activities to assess capacity needs across our existing prevention service array to determine if additional capacity is needed and additional slots of existing services, or new interventions, should be added to our Prevention Plan to be claimed under Family First.

As additional services are rated by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse, Independent Systematic Reviews are conducted and approved, or if additional capacity is needed to support prevention-eligible children and their families, and is not already funded by Medicaid or MIECHV, CFSA may continue to amend our Prevention Plan to expand our service array and specify additional services to be claimed under Family First. At this time, CFSA does not plan to submit an Independent Systematic Review (ISR) of services currently not yet rated by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse.

# Proposed Service Array

Tables 2 and 3 below provide an overview of the selected prevention services, including the service type, target population, their rating on the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse, whether each intervention is currently under review by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse, and the estimated rating that is likely to be produced by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse. These tables clearly show the high level of research evidence associated with the service array, as well as the distinct target populations and desired outcomes across programs, demonstrating that the District has selected a continuum of services that is as diverse as the needs and characteristics as the families we serve. This builds on the waiver lesson learned and our first few years of Prevention Plan implementation; that a diverse array of EBPs is necessary to ensure that each family can be matched to an EBP that aligns with their needs and circumstances. The service array is well-calibrated to effectively and comprehensively meet the needs of Family First prevention-eligible children and their caregivers and will effectively utilize the opportunity created by Family First to claim Title IV-E dollars for allowable EBP service capacity not already supported by other federal sources. Table 2 highlights the specific evidence-based prevention services, Parents As Teachers (PAT) and Motivational Interviewing (MI) that the District continues to maintain approval to claim for under Family First as part of the District’s comprehensive evidence-based prevention service array, fully outlined in Table 3.

In addition to the comprehensive prevention service array outlined above in Table 3, CFSA and sister agency partners have seen promising results in other locally implemented programs (outlined below in Table 4). While these services may not have the same level of rigor, or meet the specific criteria outlined in the Family First legislation, these programs have shown promise of effectiveness and support target populations outside of Family First prevention-eligible children and their caregivers to round-out a comprehensive city-wide prevention strategy. CFSA believes family-stabilizing services, post-permanency supports, peer-based programs for families receiving a range of mental health, substance use treatment services, or disability services, and programs to help teen parents successfully transition from care are powerful tools as part of CFSA’s comprehensive suite of interventions to meet the specific needs of children and their caregivers. Further, while these programs may incorporate one or more evidence-based models at the center of their design, CFSA recognizes the strength of coupling interventions (which many of these services do) to provide a suite of supportive services within one program.

49 Parents Anonymous (PA) is currently used as a primary prevention service intervention across the District.

Consultation and Coordination: Federal Funding for EBPs

In-home parenting and skill-based programs:

DC Health currently receives federal Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program (MIECHV)55 funds to implement the Parents As Teachers (PAT) home-visiting program model. In addition to the existing capacity supported by DC Health’s grant, DC Health also funds local program slots. CFSA will work with DC Health to determine how best to leverage existing funds and support/expand locally funded slots as needed using Family First funding. In year one, CFSA has determined to support additional slots of PAT (see Table 2) to meet the needs of the target populations identified in this plan (see Table 1). In addition to intra-district government partnerships, CFSA may also compete funds for award to private agencies to provide in-home parent skill-building evidence-based curricula. CFSA selected in-home parent skill-building programs in part due to their existing capacity, perceived effectiveness within DC, as well as the substantial number of city-wide providers with implementation expertise.

Medicaid funding and Mental Health and Substance Abuse prevention and treatment services

DBH directly contracts with mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment providers across DC. When selecting EBP services, DBH presented the services sub-group with an array of behavioral health services and treatment modalities that have been rigorously evaluated and implemented in DC for several years, and in alignment with this evidence, have been both rated by the CEBC as well-supported practices and have been approved in DC as Medicaid allowable services. Under the payer of last resort requirement, Medicaid is the primary payer for these well-supported services.

CFSA’s recommends the Children’s Bureau clarify the provided program guidance in PI 18-09 Section C56 such that the requirement around prevention spending on well-supported EBPs be 50% of all spending (inclusive of spending that is reimbursed through other programs or payers, such as MIECHV and Medicaid). Programs included in this five-year Prevention Plan that could be reimbursable through another public or private source should be included in the calculation. As the guidance is currently written, DC and other Medicaid expansion states/states that receive other federal funds are penalized for having identified and developed other federal funding sources for existing well-supported services and cannot maximize claiming under Family First. Please see Appendix B for full analysis of the impact of Medicaid expansion and Family First requirements.

While CFSA notes the tension in the requirements related to prevention program financing and federal reimbursement, EBP recommendations were made by the services sub-group with the particular focus on selecting the program models that would be the best fit to serve DC’s Family First prevention-eligible children and their caregivers while ensuring optimal levels of evidence. CFSA will continue to

PUTTING FAMILIES FIRST IN DC - CFSA’S FIVE YEAR PREVENTION PLAN

# Case Management: A Fundamental Service

To provide Family First prevention-eligible children and their caregivers with access to this array of EBPs, CFSA recognizes the critical importance of robust case management and ongoing engagement with families. CFSA’s existing practice model57 employs a trauma-informed service delivery framework that threads theory to practice through casework with families (see Section 6 for more about CFSA’s trauma-informed service delivery). Building on the lessons learned from the Waiver implementation around the challenges of service utilization and ongoing engagement in EBPs, CFSA is investing in training focused specifically on building the skills of case managers to directly provide an evidence-based case management service, Motivational Interviewing, so they in turn are better prepared to encourage and motivate meaningful connections-to and engagement-in EBP services and related services provided external to CFSA, and to enhance engagement with and achievement of the Child-Specific Prevention Plan.

# Motivational Interviewing within Case Management

Under Family First, CFSA will continue to train all agency social workers and supervisors and contracted prevention services case management providers (Collaboratives) in Motivational Interviewing (MI), which is integrated as a core component of the CFSA practice model.58 CFSA will also provide MI training to 212 DHS employees and their contracted CBO homeless services case management providers responsible for intake and case management services at the Virginia Williams Family Resource Center (VWFRC) and across the homeless services continuum of care. As a central aspect of the practice model, MI will equip the designated CFSA, Collaborative, DHS, and additional CBO caseworkers with a proven service to enhance partnering with families to set goals within the Child-Specific Prevention Plan, crafts strategies and goals, make a plan to reach those goals, and boost motivation and internal resolve to follow-through. It will be used seamlessly throughout the life of the family’s prevention case to promote uptake of services, ensure completion of services, and reduce premature drop-off, and to increase the successful attainment of the Child-Specific Prevention Plan including individualized case goals related to improved parenting skills and mental health and reductions in substance abuse.

On November 10, 2022, CFSA announced that it would rely on third-party vendor Lyssn’s platform to expand the use of Motivational Interviewing in the programs it delivers and funds.59 The platform

DC CFSA | Putting Families First in DC | December 22, 2023 | Page 31

---

PUTTING FAMILIES FIRST IN DC - CFSA’S FIVE YEAR PREVENTION PLAN

provides the agency with an easy-to-scale way to deliver Motivational Interviewing training, provide immediate feedback to users, and offer detailed reporting, including reporting specifically focused on equity issues. Lyssn licenses are available to CFSA and Collaborative caseworkers and supervisors and will soon be made available to all DHS and related CBO intake and homeless services continuum of care caseworkers. Technical guidance on how to use the platform is available on CFSA’s training website.60

MI will be carried out with fidelity as an integral component of the practice model and case management for all families served through Family First. In the MI handbook on the Title IV-E Clearinghouse, model developers William Miller and Stephen Rollnick describe MI as a “collaborative, goal-oriented style of communication with particular attention to the language of change,” which is designed to facilitate a personal change process from start to finish, and will be used accordingly by CFSA and Collaborative case managers throughout the life of the family’s prevention case.61 The handbook also describes MI as four overlapping processes: Engaging, Focusing, Evoking, and Planning—which align with and will enrich the stages in CFSA’s practice model and DHS’s practice model across the homeless services continuum of care. MI will be carried out by case managers both as:

1. Stand Alone Evidence-Based Service: To advance case goals identified in the Child-Specific Prevention Plan in partnership with families, regardless of whether the family participates in any additional EBP services throughout the life of the family’s prevention case.
2. Adjunctive Evidence-Based Service: When participation in an additional EBP is appropriate, to improve appropriate selection of the additional EBP for both children and caregivers, ensure that each family has the dedicated support and motivation to sustain engagement in often intensive service interventions—thereby bolstering outcomes of additional EBPs.

The empirical evidence available in the psychological literature has strengthened CFSA’s commitment to designing and implementing MI not only as a stand-alone service integrated within case management, but also as a service adjunctive to a broader range of preventive EBPs.

Research shows that pairing MI with PCIT and other EBPs should lead to better outcomes for children and their families. Studies have found the combination of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) and Motivational Interviewing to be effective in treating children with behavioral problems and their families. In a randomized trial involving 110 physically abusive parents, Chaffin and colleagues compared PCIT to a standard community-based parenting program. Only 19% of parents who participated in the combined PCIT and MI program were reinvestigated for child physical abuse, compared to 49% of parents who participated in the community-based program.62 A similar field implementation trial of 192 parents showed that families who participated in a six-session group program based on Miller and Rollnick’s MI principles prior to PCIT also had the lowest rates of recidivism and longer periods of time before another child maltreatment report was filed compared to other treatment options, including

PCIT without MI. A more recent study found greater reductions in externalizing and internalizing child behavior problems and parental stress among families who received a combination of motivational interviewing and PCIT, compared with waitlisted families. By providing an evidence-based service at the heart of case management to improve service engagement, CFSA is also leveraging lessons learned from the Waiver implementation to be responsive to the existing service-delivery challenges within CFSA and across the health and human services cluster, providing social services for District families. Moreover, implementation of MI within case management is responsive to case management enhancements requested by families in focus groups conducted during CFSA’s Family First planning process.

Research also clearly demonstrates MI’s effectiveness in bringing about a wide range of behavior changes when used absent another EBP, including multiple studies suggesting its effectiveness in a child welfare context and homeless services. Evidence of MI’s effectiveness is discussed further in section 4 of this plan.

While its roots are grounded in substance abuse treatment, MI has emerged as a prominent case management tool in the field of child welfare beyond substance abuse.

“Much like clients in the substance use field, child welfare clients may be ambivalent to change, which makes them good candidates for the use of motivational interviewing. Child welfare practice also tends to embrace some of the same tenets present in motivational interviewing, such as engaging clients in decisions and focusing on their strengths. Additionally, motivational interviewing incorporates self-determination, which is one of the tenets of trauma-informed care. Research has shown that motivational interviewing is also effective when paired with other treatment strategies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2017).” (Child welfare Information Gateway, 2017)

Research and evaluation to date has already highlighted MI as an effective service delivery strategy with both adult and youth populations, making it an ideal fit for CFSA’s foster care candidates and their families as well as pregnant or parenting youth in care. By providing an evidence-based service at the center of case management, CFSA will equip its public and private agency case managers, and partner.

case managers at DHS and related CBO providers, with the tools necessary to engage youth and families to make meaningful change, improve family well-being and independence, and prevent entries into foster care.

CFSA also expects the use of MI to help individuals experiencing or at risk of experience homelessness make positive changes related to substance use and housing status. Motivational interviewing is widely employed in street outreach, hostels, day centers and Housing First programs.69 Case workers who rely on MI can encourage individuals experiencing homelessness to engage with support, thereby reducing the harms associated with substance use and rough sleeping.

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA):

“The outcomes specific to MI in homeless services have been quite positive. Research has found that MI improved alcohol and drug treatment entry among veterans experiencing homelessness, and MI has been effective in reducing alcohol and drug risk among adolescents experiencing homelessness.”70

Empirical studies conducted across a 25-year period indicate that individuals who have been marginalized are likely to find MI more appealing than alternative approaches.71 Motivational interviewing to address substance use and alcohol consumption has been shown to be effective in populations experiencing homelessness,72 including adolescents.73 More importantly, there is robust evidence to suggest that MI has a large positive impact on substance use treatment entry. In one study, 95% of individuals experiencing homelessness who received MI entered residential treatment vs 71% in the control group.74

Substance use treatment entry can be an important step toward stable housing. Studies have shown that substance use, including the use of cocaine, is one of the main risk factors for homelessness75. Reducing those barriers to housing requires an evidence-based practice that will motivate individuals to seek substance use treatment entry, if such supports are needed.

# EBP Procurement

Upon approval of this original plan, CFSA established Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with sister agency partners: DC Health, the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH), the Department of Human Services (DHS) and other sister agencies as relevant, to expand or leverage their respective capacity/slots for in-home parenting, mental health, and substance use disorder services to meet the needs of CFSA’s candidate populations. By capitalizing on DC’s existing providers and service infrastructure, CFSA can ensure timely start-up with minimal costs associated with standing up new providers. In using a combination of agency partnerships and competitive procurements, CFSA’s array of evidence-based interventions afford CFSA and partner organizations the ability to create a robust prevention services continuum across District agencies and private non-profit partners.

# EBP Training/Referral Capacity Building

Ongoing case management and EBP provider trainings are needed to support start-up or ramp-up for provider’s new and existing staff. Please see Section 6 for CFSA’s training plan and activities to ensure success of the Family First programs and services across the District. In addition to trainings needed to support the ongoing implementation of EBP models, CFSA also recognizes the opportunity to better coordinate and align referral processes from the point a worker documents the Child-Specific Prevention Plan and service needs. As part of the Family First implementation, CFSA has leveraged available technology to create a referral pipeline to available EBP services and community-based resources to quickly link parents and children with appropriate services and ensure timely connection once a referral has been made. Technology updates have allowed CFSA staff and community-based organizations to effectively track engagement in EBP service delivery and support financial claiming. Staff is trained by CFSA’s Child Welfare Training Academy (CWTA) to effectively use these system enhancements in daily practice to support children and families.

# Trauma-Informed Service Delivery

children and youth in the District’s child welfare system. Since that time, CFSA, through its Child Welfare Training Academy (CWTA79) and Office of Well Being designed the Practice Guidance for Resilience, Adversity, and Trauma (PGRAT) and infused trauma-informed training components at the foundation of pre-service and in-service trainings for CFSA direct service staff, resource parents, foster care providers, and Collaborative contractors. CFSA focused the trauma grant on deepening child welfare practice through implementation of critical thinking and clinical case work practice through a trauma-informed lens. The DHS training portfolio mimics that of the Collaborative contractors. Specialized training was also developed for prevention services staff and non-direct services staff. The Trauma Systems Therapy (TST) model, an EBP shown to dramatically speed and improve healing in children who have experienced abuse or neglect without relying on medication, hospitalization, or prolonged counseling,80 was used in the initial training and development of ongoing trauma-informed practice curriculums. Please see Appendix D - Attachment III for Assurance, for each service, that each HHS approved title IV-E prevention service provided meets trauma-informed service delivery standards, per CFSA CWTA.

# Improving Outcomes

By providing children and families at risk of foster care entry with an expanded array of well-implemented evidence-based preventive services, coupled with evidence-based case management using motivational interviewing techniques to support service uptake and participation, DC posits that outcomes for families will be significantly improved in accordance with the intended outcomes of each program. For example, parents enrolled in substance abuse treatment EBPs will experience reductions in problematic patterns of use; parents and children enrolled in dyadic therapy will experience improved attachment; and a teen enrolled in an EBP focused on improving mental and behavioral health will experience increased pro-social behaviors and reduced acting out. These improvements in individual and family functioning will in turn lead to reduced child maltreatment and, ultimately, reduced demand for foster care as the preventive services expand. CFSA’s Theory of Change (see the Evaluation section) depicts the sequence of causal events and mechanisms by which outcomes for children, families, and communities are expected to improve due to Family First.

79 The Initiative to Improve Access to Needs-Driven, Evidence-Based/Informed Mental and Behavioral Health Services in Child Welfare was awarded to CFSA in October 2012 by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The grant was for $3.2 million ($640,000/year for five years). While funding was anticipated to cease in 2017, CFSA received a one year no cost extension to spend remaining funds in 2018.

PUTTING FAMILIES FIRST IN DC - CFSA’S FIVE YEAR PREVENTION PLAN

# Consultation and Coordination: Stakeholder Engagement in Target Population and EBP Service Selection

As a small and agile jurisdiction, DC is uniquely poised to regularly convene key staff and stakeholders across all levels of government. As noted in Sections 1 and 2, the candidate populations (Section 1) and the evidence-based services and outcomes (Section 2) were all determined through a robust stakeholder engagement leading up to the submission and ongoing amendments of this five-year plan.

Beginning in June of 2018, CFSA launched our Family First planning process through the creation of DC’s Family First Prevention Work Group (Work Group). The Work Group was charged with making key recommendations for CFSA’s five-year Prevention Plan by (a) Identifying target populations for services, including upstream (primary prevention) target populations and candidates for foster care, and (b) recommending the best-fit evidence-based interventions to meet District families' specific service needs.

The Work Group participants included leadership and program staff from across DC government and local community-based organizations, including DC’s Health and Human Services cluster agencies, DC City Council, the Executive Office of the Mayor, Family Court, CFSA’s court monitor, advocacy organization partners, and CFSA’s community-based child-abuse prevention partners, the Healthy Families, Thriving Communities Collaboratives (Collaboratives).

In the subsequent years Figure 4 (2018 - present), CFSA has transformed and repurposed the focus and the goal of the convening stakeholders with an eye towards co-creating and co-designing a Child and Family Well-Being System. Updating our governance structure to consist of a Planning Committee, Citywide Prevention Workgroup (Steering Committee), and subcommittees in the areas of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB), Warmline/Community Response, and Impact & Evaluation. This refresh of our city-wide prevention efforts has helped to actualize and shape the District’s three priority areas: 1) deepen the community capacity building and support infrastructure of the District’s Family Success Centers, 2) stand up a community-based Warmline to divert calls from the Child Protection Services (CPS) Hotline that are not safety related, and 3) create a community-supporter model whereby individuals with lived expertise in their communities respond to calls that come into the Warmline.

# CFSA’s commitment to meaningfully engaging community members with lived experience continues to manifest in the City-Wide Prevention Work Group (also known as the TFSC steering committee), which is shepherding the District’s transformation to a Child and Family Well-Being System.

- Birth parents and caregivers lend their voice through our Lived Experience (LEX) Advisory Council, facilitate presentations, and drive strategic planning in recurring meetings and through participation in subcommittees actively designing a supportive community framework.
- To establish an environment in which families can reach out for support without fear of stigma or child welfare involvement, the Warmline and Community Response subcommittee is developing tools, standards, and protocols for affecting a prompt, safe, and supportive warmline and community response model. As a baseline, this subcommittee is changing policy to actualize the vision for mandated supporters vs. strictly mandated reporters across our DC community.
- The Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging subcommittee is ensuring everyone’s voice is included in the development of a supportive community, that there is a shared understanding of “lived experience,” and that equity concepts are not only applied to race and culture, but to a broad variety of backgrounds, circumstances, and conditions.
- The Impact and Evaluation subcommittee is emphasizing “change on the ground” as a basis for evaluating interventions and working to achieve a true understanding of “well-being” based on input from a diverse array of community members.

Many of the efforts the agency has undertaken over the past four years to gather community feedback have confirmed a need to have a citywide coordinated response around issues of food insecurity, mental health, housing, and employment. Homelessness is not an issue that occurs in a vacuum, but one that intersects with multiple social concerns. If we are able to address the root causes of homelessness such as affordable housing, income, food security, discrimination, and violence, CFSA posits this Title IV-E Prevention Plan will impact the cycle of poverty and homelessness experienced by families as part of our overall District-wide prevention strategy.

CFSA will continue to engage youth and family stakeholders in the process of providing feedback about the quality and fit of evidence-based programs and services. CFSA uses multiple venues and methods as part of our Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) efforts to garner parent and youth input. For example, focus groups are convened as part of our annual Needs Assessment and Resource Development Plan, the completion of our FY20-24 Child and Family Services Plan and Annual Progress and Services Report, and ongoing community-engagement events hosted by our community-based Collaborative partners. The newest addition to our budding Child and Family Well-Being System is the created of our LEX Advisory Council. The LEX Advisory Council is comprised of individuals with lived experience with the Child Welfare Agency and other District government agencies and community-based organizations. The LEX Advisory Council meets monthly as is charged with informing and guiding the work of the City-Wide Prevention Work Group (Steering Committee) and weighing in on important topics and decisions to actualize all aspects of our Child and Family Well-Being system.

Underpinning all work of the Prevention Work Group is CFSA’s Planning Team (renamed in 2022 to the Core Team), a project management team comprised of CFSA’s Director, program staff from across.

# Section 3: Monitoring Child Safety and Risk

# Role of the Prevention Specialist (Liaison)

CFSA has designated Office of Thriving Families/Community Partnerships Administration program staff (Prevention Specialists) to serve as sister-agency and community-based organization liaisons for all city-wide prevention services. All five Collaboratives have a designated Prevention Specialist (aka Collaborative Liaison), and all DHS staff and CBO providers have a designated Prevention Specialist (aka DHS Liaison). The Collaborative and DHS Liaisons are responsible for supporting staff as needed with all aspects of child-specific prevention plan management, training, EBP service delivery, and CQI. In addition to determining initial child-specific eligibility for prevention services, the Prevention Specialists (Liaisons) are each responsible for determining child-specific candidate eligibility for each 12-month prevention plan period based on the results of ongoing assessments conducted by case management staff and management reports.

# Front Porch and Front Door – “Known-to-CFSA”

During the 12-month period when EBP services are being delivered to Family First prevention-eligible children and their caregivers in the Front Porch and Front Door candidacy populations, CFSA will ensure that each child receives a thorough and accurate assessment of risk on a regular basis through one or both of the following mechanisms: (1) informal risk assessment on an ongoing basis, for example through conversations and observations of the family dynamics and/or the home, by staff formally trained to assess risk or (2) formal risk assessment through completion of the SDM risk assessment instrument every 90 days (families engaged with CFSA). Protocols for both formal and informal risk assessments for families involved with CFSA are outlined in longstanding CFSA in-home services policy, stating that “CFSA in-home and private agency (as applicable) staff shall continually assess for safety and risk factors throughout the family's involvement with the District’s child welfare system, starting with the initial contact and ending with a safe case closure.” The policy clearly indicates that CFSA staff as well as staff at the Collaboratives and CFSA’s foster care provider conduct routine safety and risk assessments for all cases. Furthermore, Collaborative and foster care provider staff are required to carry out periodic risk assessments through their contracts with CFSA.

In addition, as of October 1, 2019, clinicians delivering EBP services to Family First prevention-eligible children and their caregivers are also required through Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) between CFSA and sister agencies to complete risk assessments as outlined above for cases where there is no CFSA, Collaborative, or contracted case manager. Through the fulfillment of this requirement, all Family First prevention-eligible children and their caregivers receiving Family First EBP services will receive periodic risk assessments. The result will be that risk assessments will be conducted by the family worker that is most closely engaged with the family at any point in the case, acknowledging that risk.

assessments are more accurate when conducted by a worker who routinely engages with the family.

# Front Yard – “Community Pathway”

During the 12-month period when EBP services are being delivered to Family First prevention-eligible children and their caregivers in the Front Yard candidacy population, CFSA will ensure that each child receives a thorough and accurate assessment of risk on a regular basis through informal risk assessment, including though conversations and observations of the family dynamics and/or the home, by DHS staff and providers formally trained to assess risk.

DHS staff and housing case management providers currently conduct regular formal assessments with families every 90 days to assess housing needs using the Family Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool (F-SPDAT). Informal risk assessment results and information gathered through the F-SPDAT tool will be monitored alongside progress toward service goals by the responsible caseworker or clinician. If a child’s risk of entering foster care does not improve at a reasonable rate during or following the provision of services, the Prevention Plan will be reassessed, in coordination with the DHS Liaison, and changed as needed. If safety concerns warrant a call to the CPS Hotline, the DHS staff or contracted CBO provider will call as needed. CFSA will use management reports as well as the support of DHS staff and staff within CFSA’s prevention unit to ensure claiming ceases when a child is determined to no longer be a candidate prior to the 12-month time limit.

The reasonable rate at which risk of foster care entry can be expected to diminish will vary among cases due to unique family and case circumstances as well as significant variations in the length of each service, which range from three months to multiple years. Responsible caseworkers or clinicians will be trained through pre-service and in-service training to identify a “reasonable risk reduction” rate and thereby determine whether a Prevention Plan change is needed. The Child Welfare Training Academy has created specific trainings for CFSA, DHS, and respective community-based providers to support ongoing community-based safety monitoring and risk assessment tools. CWTA will additionally be updating guidance and training as mandated reporter laws and policies/procedures may change to incorporate and distinguish mandated reporters from mandated supporters.

Collaborative and DHS staff managing cases are mandated reporters and will receive mandated reporting training and will be trained by CFSA’s Child Welfare Training Academy (CWTA) to conduct informal risk assessments to continually assess risk and threats to a child’s safety. If the designated staff determines that risk of foster care entry remains based on these assessments, they will communicate with the DHS Liaison to re-examine the Prevention Plan. For families who are served by sister agencies or community organizations providing prevention services, it is the expectation that these agencies assess risk through informal or formal risk assessment. All CFSA staff, DHS staff, sister agency staff, and prevention services contractors will be trained to conduct informal risk assessments. If it is determined that risk remains, the sister agency or community partner will communicate the assessed risk to CFSA, Collaborative, or DHS/CBO staff responsible for that family’s prevention-plan management. If the Collaborative or DHS/CBO staff determines that risk of foster care entry remains high based on this assessment, the Collaborative or DHS/contracted CBO staff will communicate with their designated.

PUTTING FAMILIES FIRST IN DC - CFSA’S FIVE YEAR PREVENTION PLAN

# Section 4: Evaluation Strategy and Waiver Request

On April 12, 2018, the Children’s Bureau⁸² issued the following information regarding evaluation strategies for services reimbursable through Family First:

The state must have well-designed and rigorous evaluation strategy for any promising, supported, or well-supported practice. HHS may waive this requirement if HHS deems the evidence of the effectiveness of the practice to be compelling and the state meets the continuous quality improvement requirements with regard to the practice. The state cannot receive FAMILY FIRST for the program or service unless the evaluation strategy is included in the five-year plan.⁸³

In addition to the criteria above, at least 50% of the expenditures reimbursed by federal funds must be for prevention services and programs that meet the requirements for supported or well-supported practices starting in FY22, and well-supported practices starting in FY24. Programs that are well-supported may not require rigorous evaluation however CFSA would still be required to provide a plan for continuous quality improvement (CQI) with regard to ongoing practice.

# Purpose of Evaluation

As reflected previously in this Prevention Plan, CFSA proposes to offer a comprehensive array of evidence-based prevention services to children and families at risk of becoming involved with the child welfare system. The legislation states that programs whose evidence of effectiveness is supported or promising will be formally and rigorously evaluated by CFSA, as outlined within this evaluation strategy.

As permitted through the legislation with the approval of an evaluation Waiver, the implementation and effectiveness of well-supported programs will be assessed through robust CQI internal to CFSA rather than through formal evaluations. However, due to the existing federal funding mechanisms in place to support the existing service capacity, at the time of this submission, CFSA will be focusing on the implementation of the PAT and MI models only for Family First claiming. As more EBPs are reviewed and approved by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse, the District may submit an amendment to the five-year plan with a description of the updated evaluation plan.

It should be noted that while CFSA will focus on PAT and MI for Family First claiming, in support of its city-wide prevention services evaluation and CQI strategy, CFSA will leverage evaluation and State level CQI to examine all interventions collectively, comparing outcomes against federal and local outcomes of children, youth, and families served during the first five years of the Prevention Plan.

The evidence-based programs that will be monitored through CQI for Family First, formally evaluated, or monitored through CQI as part of the local prevention services CQI strategy below (State level CQI) are listed below in Table 6. While information in this table assumes the accuracy of the estimated Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse ratings listed in Tables 2 and 3 above, adjustments will be made if.

# Evaluation and CQI Capacity and Approach

CFSA is deeply committed to evaluating the effectiveness of the supported and promising programs we invest in through Family First and to carrying out robust CQI to understand fidelity and outcomes for well-supported programs. Moreover, we are poised to use the evidence gained through the evaluations and CQI to inform refinements to program implementation, changes to the service array, and practice improvements. As mentioned previously, lessons learned from the Waiver point to the importance of monitoring and ongoing refinement of business processes and implementation in order to maximize the impact of EBPs. Utilizing evaluation and CQI findings intentionally to improve practice and service.

# Provision and Resources

Provision will be critical to our success in carrying out the vision inspired by Family First. Accordingly, CFSA has marshalled the following internal and external resources for completing rigorous evaluations of programs and robust CQI as part of Family First.

- Internal Evaluation Team: CFSA has hired an Evaluation Team specifically to design, lead, carry out, document, and communicate evaluations for supported and promising programs under Family First, as well as manage CQI for well-supported programs. These staff possess expert knowledge of evaluation design and methodology. They sit within CFSA’s Office of Community Partnerships, where they are deeply rooted in the programmatic aspects of Family First implementation, supporting the team’s analysis using implementation science and CQI activities, while also serving as cross-functional data-analytics team in partnership with CFSA’s Performance Accountability and Quality Improvement Administration (PAQIA), where they receive direct support from PAQIA analysts responsible for generating CFSA’s administrative data.
- Ongoing CQI support from Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago: Chapin Hall is currently contracted to provide support to CFSA on development and implementation of CQI systems. As part of this support, Chapin Hall CQI experts advised the Evaluation and Data Analytics unit on development and launch of a CQI system that aligned and integrated Family First requirements with CFSA’s broader strategic direction and State Level CQI efforts.

# Theory of Change

In support of CFSA’s Four Pillar strategic framework, the Agency seeks to leverage Family First funding to make investments to support family stability and preservation, to increase protective factors, to reduce risk factors for child abuse and neglect, and to ultimately prevent children from entering foster care.

CFSA’s theory of change assumes that mental health conditions, substance misuse, and lack of parenting skills and knowledge can significantly diminish any parent’s capacity to ensure their child’s well-being and provide them with a safe, permanent home where they can thrive. Data clearly demonstrate families struggling with one or more of these challenges are more likely to experience crises that bring their children in to foster care. Therefore, if CFSA provides families whose children are at risk of entering foster care with access to an expanded array of intensive and evidence-based services in the communities where they live, as well as critical case management and motivational enhancement support to help them engage and sustain participation throughout the healing and capacity-building process, make challenging changes due to increased motivation, family functioning will improve, stabilization will occur, and children will enter and re-enter foster care at lower rates.

PUTTING FAMILIES FIRST IN DC - CFSA’S FIVE YEAR PREVENTION PLAN

# Evaluation Design

The District does not intend to claim for any allowable supported or promising practice EBPs available under Family First at the time of this submission. The District will only seek approval to leverage Family First funding for PAT and MI, both well-supported models, at the time of this submission. Therefore, an evaluation description is not required at this time. As additional services are added to the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse, the District may submit amendments to this five-year Prevention Plan along with a full evaluation design for any supported or promising models implemented. The following high-level evaluation approach outlined in this section will be used to guide the development of a detailed evaluation design for any promising or supported programs that are submitted under a future plan amendment.

The evaluation of each supported and promising program consists of two studies: a process evaluation and an outcomes evaluation. The targeted programs are provided across multiple agencies in the health and human services cluster and engage the family, community partners, and other systems of care. Experience has shown that regardless of policies and procedures that might be created at the system level to support activities, making sure that providers and specialists in the field are following proscribed policies and practices can often be difficult. For this reason, it is critical to remain mindful that many different parts of the child welfare system, including CFSA and its sister agencies, are involved in implementation. Consequently, while interventions must be evaluated individually, they must be evaluated within the broader context of the child welfare landscape. The evaluation components are described below.

# Process evaluation

For the process evaluation, CFSA examines how each supported and promising program and associated administrative supports and processes were implemented within CFSA, Collaboratives, and in each of the sister agencies at multiple levels simultaneously.

- Research Question 1: Was each program implemented as the model intended? CFSA assesses implementation fidelity in accordance with each program’s unique model fidelity standards. CFSA liaise with model developers to obtain measures, specific methodology, and tools for assessing model fidelity, and develop internal processes and systems for monitoring fidelity of each program on a periodic basis. Findings are used to inform training and supervision to ensure that the proven benefits of the model are realized through faithful implementation, and to ensure that outcomes can accurately be attributed to the model.

Where possible, CFSA works with national model developers on conducting fidelity assessments to ensure Family First programs are implemented with fidelity. As with the Waiver, CFSA continues to track fidelity by capturing components of training, fidelity to practice standards which include findings from annual site visits, case record reviews, and review of local documentation detailing referral criteria, caseload size and make-up, supervision sessions, and face-to-face contacts. CFSA makes recommendations on consistent fidelity tools and metrics across programs and organizations that range from training to fidelity to practice standards.

# Research Question 2:

To what extent did each program reach the intended target population? This component of the process evaluation assesses the degree to which families within the target population and are eligible are receiving each service (reach). This information is viewed in the context of the overall successes and challenges of implementation and the related competency, organization, and leadership drivers that may have influenced referrals, service uptake, and service completion for each program.

# Research Question 3:

Did CFSA and the DC health and human services system support implementation of services in a way that optimized fidelity to the model, effective operations, and successful outcomes? The focus of a process evaluation is on the organization’s ability or capacity to support programs to reach their stated goals. The process study periodically assesses progress made citywide in implementing infrastructure and implementation supports, and the degree to which services are reaching the target population. The process study utilizes metrics built by the CQI Subgroup prior to implementation of the programs. They focus on system changes such as workforce (e.g., staffing configuration, training), interagency collaboration and consultation around service delivery (e.g., case handoffs, referral tracking), fidelity to the business process for developing and updating Prevention Plans, and fidelity to the business process for service referrals.

# Outcomes Evaluation.

The outcomes evaluation assesses the degree to which the supported and promising programs achieve the intended outcomes for children and families associated with each individual program model, as well as distal outcomes related to reduced repeat maltreatment and reduced foster care entry and re-entry. CFSA partners with model developers and service providers for each program to determine appropriate program outcomes, associated metrics, and data collection tools and methodologies, anticipating that specific outcomes measured and tools for collected these data will vary between programs.

# The research questions and designs to follow are solely initial considerations.

# Research Question 4:

To what extent did the evidence-based practices and other programs meet anticipated outcomes? The evaluation may utilize a quasi-experimental matched pre-test/post-test design for discharged families to determine the extent to which outcomes were met at the time of discharge. Design for enrolled participants has not yet been determined.

# Research Question 5:

Was there a significant difference in achievement of outcomes for the intervention group compared to a similar group from the pre-intervention time frame? Quasi-experimental design with a matched historical comparison group using propensity score matching may be utilized to understand outcomes of program participants relative to a comparable group of families from an earlier time period who did not receive the intervention.

# Waiver Request

Please see Appendix D - Attachment II for each State Request for Waiver of Evaluation Requirements for a Well-Supported Practice. The requests in Attachment II align with Table 5: EBPs Formal Evaluation or CQI Requirement above.

# Parents as Teachers (PAT)

# CQI Strategy

Section 471(e)(5)(B)(iii)(II) states a prevention services and programs plan component shall include how implementation of the services or programs will be continuously monitored to ensure fidelity to the practice model and to determine outcomes achieved and how information learned from the monitoring will be used to refine and improve practices. The information in this section details CQI plans for PAT and how CFSA meets the continuous monitoring requirements. For the full CQI plan that includes specific outcomes to be achieved, data collection methods and tools, and all CQI activities related to PAT, please see Attachment V-FY19 DC MIECHV CQI Plan.

PAT has been historically funded through MIECHV. As previously mentioned, in year one of implementation, the District worked with our partner agency, DC Health to perform CQI on this well-supported model. The District will leverage Family First funding for additional capacity added to the PAT program starting immediately in year one. It should be noted that there have been no adaptations to the original model, and it is presently being implemented in alignment with the versions reflected in the manuals on the Clearinghouse.84 DC Health has served as the program coordinator of the MIECHV Home Visiting program in the District for nearly 10 years, inclusive of the PAT model. In that time, DC Health has developed a robust CQI plan in accordance with the MIECHV program guidelines. CFSA partners with DC Health to leverage the robust CQI plan already established for PAT while integrating limited additional data analysis specific to child welfare as detailed below.

# CQI governance for PAT

CQI governance for PAT is detailed in the FY19 DC MIECHV CQI Plan:

CQI initiatives are implemented by two quality improvement teams collaboratively focused on identified areas in need of improvement at both the State and Local levels of the DC MIECHV program. The state CQI team will concentrate its efforts on the state-level system and infrastructure supports. The local CQI teams will focus on program service delivery improvements. Each team will be responsible for selecting and implementing the CQI interventions (change activities) designed to drive improvement in selected topic areas...

The organizational system consists of three teams, the LIA CQI Managers Team, LIA CQI Home Visitors Team, and the DC Health CQI Team. The DC Health personnel assigned to the CQI Teams are the: MIECHV Program Coordinator and DC Health Public Health Analyst, who serve as the.

PAT is a copyrighted model, which prohibits the District from copying and distributing the program's manual and materials. However, Mary's Center, DC’s local PAT service provider, is an affiliate of the Parents As Teachers' (PAT) national office. CFSA has included a copy of Mary’s Center’s PAT certificate of affiliation as Attachment VI. As an affiliate, Mary's Center is implementing the PAT to the fidelity to the model with no adaptations. In addition to maintaining their certification, the program adheres to the 20 Essential Requirements, including as Attachment VII, of the PAT model to ensure high-quality service delivery.

# CQI Lead Team. 85

CFSA includes a CFSA social worker on the LIA CQI Home Visitors Team and CFSA CQI representative to the DC Health CQI Team. CFSA seamlessly integrates into the already existing CQI activities and tailor them to meet the needs of the child welfare population. In addition, these CFSA staff are charged with routinely reporting key CQI results and insights back to CFSA for oversight of the PAT program.

The integration of CFSA into the existing plan requires PDSA cycles related to 1) how CFSA social workers explain the referral and program to families, especially voluntary participation and 2) assurance that a family's participation status and results of PAT specific assessments will not negatively impact their involvement with CFSA. In addition, CFSA will analyze data to obtain subsequent maltreatment and foster care entry rates for PAT participants referred by CFSA. While these outcomes are not in the MIECHV CQI plan, they are critical for CFSA and will be integrated into CFSA’s agency-level reviews of PAT performance data. Thus, the role of the CFSA CQI representative is to develop and implement PDSA cycles related to these requirements at CFSA. The District (DC Health and CFSA) will include the following CQI structure in the FY20 MIECHV CQI Plan and all changes are contingent upon the Health Services and Resources Administration (HRSA) approval. A copy of the final FY20 MIECHV CQI Plan will be provided upon HRSA approval in April 2020.

# Organizational Diagram of DC’s MIECHV Home Visiting Program (PAT)

The DC MIECHV organizational system consists of three teams, the LIA CQI Managers Team, LIA CQI Home Visitors Team, and the DC Health CQI Team. The DC Health personnel assigned to the CQI Teams will be the MIECHV Program Coordinator and DC Health Public Health Analyst. The CFSA personnel assigned to the CQI Teams will be the Performance Accountability & Quality Improvement Administration (PAQIA) Management Analyst and the Office of Youth Empowerment (OYE) and/or Entry Services Supervisory Social Worker.

As detailed in the FY19 DC MIECHV CQI Plan:

The DC Health CQI team will be responsible for overseeing all CQI activities. The state team will take lead and is responsible for reviewing MIECHV data on a quarterly basis to track fidelity and progress against Benchmarks. Based on these data findings, the team will identify strategies for supporting the LIA (local CQI team) in implementing improvements…

The MIECHV Program Coordinator and DC Health Public Health Analyst (DC Health CQI Co-Leads) oversee all CQI activities. The DC Health CQI team is responsible for assisting the LIA in identifying areas for improvement. The LIA is responsible for developing the Model for Improvement Worksheet and the DC Health CQI team will provide technical assistance in the development of the Worksheet that includes the proposal for change (PDSA). Once the change has been implemented, the DC Health CQI team will schedule a teleconference to discuss the results. The LIA managers/supervisors will determine if the change will be adopted, adapted or abandoned, and if another test of change is warranted. The DC Health CQI team may offer technical assistance in helping the LIA determine the best strategy for a new test of change…

Monthly check-ins will be used to share and review data charts and analysis, when appropriate, around CQI activities to provide opportunities for team discussion and encourage requests for technical assistance where needed, as well as share progress and successes. Individualized data

reports and analyses will also be shared in 1-on-1 sessions.⁸⁶

Designated CFSA CQI and prevention staff will join the existing team structure to contribute to all CQI activities.

# Compelling Evidence of Effectiveness

Pursuant to section 471(e)(5)(C)(ii), the requirement for a well-designed and rigorous evaluation of any well-supported practice may be waived if the evidence of effectiveness of the practice is deemed compelling and the CQI requirements of Section 471(e)(5)(B)(iii)(II) are met. The District asserts the evidence of the effectiveness of PAT is both compelling and evident as supported by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse’s Summary of Findings, which reflect findings from a dozen evaluations, as well as consistently strong local evaluations over nearly a decade in the District of Columbia.

Current studies of PAT show a significant impact on a number of outcomes vital to the child welfare system. In March of 2019, Parents As Teachers published a Fact Sheet, Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, reporting the following impacts of PAT on child abuse and neglect:

- In one of the largest research studies in the U.S. conducted to investigate the impact of home visiting on child maltreatment, researchers found a 22% decreased likelihood of substantiated cases of child maltreatment (as reported by Child Protective Services) for Parents as Teachers families compared to the non-PAT families.
- In a randomized-controlled trial of Parents as Teachers for CPS-involved families, the program was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of CPS for non-depressed mothers…
- Parents as Teachers participation was related to 50% fewer cases of suspected abuse and/or neglect. Parents as Teachers in Maine focusing on families with involvement with Child Protective Services, found that once entered into a Parents as Teachers program 95% of families had no further substantiated reports or allegations of child abuse.⁸⁷

Additionally, a review by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse shows that PAT had favorable⁸⁸ and statistically significant impacts on child safety as well as child social and cognitive functions, which are key outcomes in the District’s prevention service array. The District understands the impact of caregiver well-being on overall child well-being and thus considers the positive impact of PAT on positive parenting practices to be a significant component of the effectiveness of the program. It should be noted that according to the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse review, PAT has produced no unfavorable impacts on outcomes. A summary of this review’s findings can be found in Table 7 below.

As previously mentioned, PAT was originally implemented as part of DC Health’s Home Visiting program in 2010 through funding from HRSA’s MIECHV grant. Since implementation, PAT has maintained fidelity to the model and provided outcomes data in support of effectiveness as required under the MIECHV grant guidelines. Complementing the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse’s findings showing both programs’ effectiveness, results from The Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness (HomVEE) review recently published in September 2019, which reviewed the evidence of effectiveness of 21 home visiting programs, reported that most home visiting models, including PAT, had favorable impacts on.

primary measures of child development and school readiness and positive parenting practices. The study also showed that PAT participants sustained favorable impacts for at least one year after beginning the program. Additionally, as the child welfare community moves toward studying implementation science and understanding the facilitators of successful program implementation, CFSA recognizes the need for interventions that not only guarantee sustainable and favorable outcomes, but also interventions that demonstrate successful program implementation at the local level. The HomVEE report provides evidence that minimum standards for fidelity have been met in the areas of supervision, frequency of visits, pre-service training, use of fidelity tools, and an established system for fidelity monitoring, furthering CFSA confidence in the effectiveness of this model.

# Motivational Interviewing

# CQI Strategy

As previously mentioned, Section 471(e)(5)(B)(iii)(II) states a prevention services and programs plan component shall include how implementation of the services or programs will be continuously monitored to ensure fidelity to the practice model and to determine outcomes achieved and how information learned from the monitoring will be used to refine and improve practices. The information in this section details CQI plans for MI and how CFSA plans to meet the continuous monitoring requirements, which will also be implemented as part of year one activities under Family First.

The District will leverage Family First funds to implement MI. The District has performed CQI on this well-supported model since year one of implementation. It should be noted there are no adaptations to the original model, and it is presently being implemented in alignment with the model handbook as noted on the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse.

CFSA’s theory of change assumes that the use of MI by CFSA and Collaborative case managers, and designated DHS staff, will enhance clients’ motivation to make difficult behavior changes, including reducing problematic behaviors such as substance abuse and negative parenting practices and improving mental health, as well as increasing behaviors encouraged through the case plan, such as service engagement, participation, and completion, and building on personal and family strengths. By motivating positive change as well as increased uptake and sustained participation in services, MI will strengthen child and family protective factors, improve well-being, and address risks (such as housing instability). This improved family functioning will lead to a decrease in repeat maltreatment and entries into foster care.

Accordingly, the key outcomes of Motivational Interviewing that will be reviewed through CFSA’s CQI process include:

- Increased engagement and retention in services
- Increased achievement of plan goals
- Decreased reports of maltreatment
- Decreased entries in to foster care

Through CQI, CFSA will also assess key implementation drivers and fidelity to the model. The Family First Implementation Team (Implementation Team), which is comprised of core CFSA program managers, administrators, and subject matter experts, is responsible for overseeing all CQI activities to help realize the outcomes listed above. The Implementation Team reviews quantitative and qualitative data on a periodic basis to assess implementation, track fidelity to the model, and assess child and family outcomes. In these meetings, findings are discussed with an eye to ensuring quality implementation and identifying changes to improve implementation and outcomes. Key findings from CQI reviews of MI and other Family First EBPs are also be presented and discussed on regular intervals in DC’s city-wide Family First Prevention Workgroup (Steering Committee), comprising leadership and quality assurance staff from the diverse District agencies and providers partnering with CFSA to implement Family First services. This group will serve as a forum for reflection and decision-making among the agencies jointly responsible for the City’s preventive services array.

Fidelity of MI practice will be measured continuously using Lyssn, a third-party platform that utilizes artificial intelligence to evaluate audio and video recordings of MI sessions. Built on millions of lines of training data, Lyssn automates performance-based feedback and is designed for practitioners’ own reflection and growth. Lyssn’s MI performance metrics were derived or adapted from the Motivational Interview Skills Code (MISC; versions 2.1 and 2.5) and the Motivational Integrity Treatment Manual (MITI; version 4.2.1). Key metrics include an MI proficiency score, empathy, collaboration, and practitioner behaviors that are consistent/inconsistent with MI, such as advising, affirming, confronting, facilitating, and giving information (See Lyssn’s Clinical Quality Metrics, Attachment X).

MI scores will be shared with supervisors and reviewed quarterly by the Family First Implementation Team to ensure fidelity to the model and to develop change activities that support the continued successful implementation of MI. It should be noted that supervisors are expected to assess worker’s use of MI techniques as part of required regular case worker supervision, providing real-time feedback and discussion within the context of supervision.

Lyssn will also provide yearly metrics on the platform’s overall Natural Language Processing (NLP) performance and equity. All updates will be included in an annual report shared with CFSA by the thirty-first day of August of each year. Equity refers to platform’s reliability with a variety of population groups. Performance and equity metrics will include accuracy scores, recall scores, precision scores, F1 scores, AUROC, RMSE, and/or R². Lyssn will review and discuss those performance metrics during an annual performance meeting. Furthermore, Lyssn is required to immediately notify CFSA of any detected, statistically significant decrease in the platform’s performance and/or equity metrics.

# Compelling Evidence of Effectiveness

Pursuant to section 471(e)(5)(C)(ii), the requirement for a well-designed and rigorous evaluation of any well-supported practice may be waived if the evidence of effectiveness of the practice is deemed compelling and the CQI requirements of Section 471(e)(5)(B)(iii)(II) are met.

A review by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse, focused on youth and parent/caregiver substance use, shows that MI had favorable and statistically significant impacts on Adult well-being. Additionally, research has demonstrated the effectiveness of MI in bringing about a range of behavior.

changes, such as improved oral health behaviors, self-management behaviors for patients with type II diabetes, diet and exercise, and cognitive and behavioral change among domestic violence offenders. Furthermore, recent research supports the use of the model specifically in the child welfare field. A 2015 publication titled Application of Motivational Interviewing Techniques in Child Welfare authored by the Center of Advanced Studies in Child Welfare at the University of Minnesota School of Social Work highlights evaluations demonstrating that MI may be effective in child welfare-specific contexts, including engagement of families in comprehensive assessments, juvenile corrections, and child protection work with alcohol-abusing parents. The article also clearly articulates the potential benefits of MI’s use by child welfare caseworkers for promoting client engagement and improving case outcomes. Moreover, a 2018 publication, Partnering With Parents: Reviewing the Evidence for Motivational Interviewing in Child Welfare, found that in a literature review of 16 articles studying the effectiveness of MI in child welfare, 12 suggested MI’s value for improving outcomes, including parenting skills, parent/child mental health, retention in services, substance use, and child welfare recidivism.

MI has been shown to be a practical intervention for precipitating diverse types of behavior change. Although MI originated in the field of substance abuse, model developers William Miller and Stephen Rollnick have encouraged the evolution of the model’s use to address a wide range of behavior changes. The third and most recent edition of the MI manual, which is listed on the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse, describes MI as a model with wide applications in diverse fields, and the authors purport to have “broadened the application of MI to behavior change more generally, no longer limited to addictive behaviors.” In accordance with the manual and with research on MI’s effectiveness, CFSA will use MI with clients to precipitate diverse behavior changes. CFSA is confident that MI is an appropriate intervention for application to help engage families and enhance their motivation to participate in the Prevention Plan and services and change the range of behaviors that may contribute to child maltreatment.

# State Level CQI Activities

To complement the rigorous CQI methodology used to assess the PAT program, the District will conduct CQI to examine the implementation and effectiveness of its prevention approach broadly.

As discussed previously, CFSA has taken steps to partner closely with the Collaboratives as well as the District’s Health and Human Services cluster agencies on the planning for core aspects of Family First through the Family First Prevention Work Group (Steering Committee). Since implementation of services, a subset of this group has shifted roles to become the citywide Family First Prevention Plan Implementation Team and oversees ongoing CQI activities for across the city’s prevention services array and in alignment with all State level CQI activities. CFSA Office of Thriving Families/Community Partnerships Administration program staff (Prevention Specialists) are all members of the Family First Implementation Team and are designated to serve as sister-agency liaisons for all city-wide prevention services. Each Prevention Specialist is dedicated to actualizing recurring CQI activities/meetings in partnership with the Evaluation and Data Analytics team (EDA) and relevant staff/contractors. As DHS becomes a formal partner in the implementation of Motivational Interviewing, a Prevention Specialist (DHS Liaison) will formally step into the role of supporting all aspects of CQI activities, including guiding development of metrics for the process evaluation, monitoring and data collection activities, root cause analysis, and development of proposed solutions to identified issues or problems in partnership with EDA. All CQI activities will be guided by the Districts’ approved Prevention Plan.

# Consultation and Coordination

As the Work Group shifted from a function of planning to implementation, including a deepening focus on child and family well-being and State level CQI, the group has naturally emerged as a forum for consultation and coordination on delivery and administration of services among CFSA, sister agencies, Collaboratives, and other partners. The venue provides all participants with a role in monitoring, overseeing, and managing the ongoing operations and outcomes of the prevention services. As CQI and evaluation results point to the need for changes in programs or operations, the Work Group will identify solutions and improvements with the benefit of the entire Health and Human Service cluster, Collaboratives, and other partners represented at the table, thus advancing better intra-city coordination on citywide prevention services, including integration with Families First DC and all primary prevention activities conducted at CFSA and across the District.

# Section 5: Child Welfare Workforce Support

# CFSA’s Workforce Development Infrastructure

CFSA is well poised to ensure ongoing support and enhancement of a competent, skilled, and professional child welfare workforce to deliver trauma-informed and evidence-based services to children and families. CFSA’s Child Welfare Training Academy (CWTA), a dedicated team of clinically licensed social work training and supervisory staff, is designed to provide the District of Columbia’s CFSA social workers, resource parents, and community partners with the knowledge, skills, support, and coaching to effectively promote the safety, permanence, and well-being of children and families. CWTA is a part of the newly formed Development and Equity Administration at CFSA, charged with formalizing CFSA’s priority towards inclusion, belonging, and workforce well-being.104 CWTA trainings are provided through CFSA’s pre-service (training for new hires) and in-service (ongoing staff training and continuing education (CEU)) training series designed to keep all family-serving CFSA staff, sister agencies partners, community-based organizations, and resource parents informed to effectively carry out their role as trauma-informed child welfare professionals and caregivers. CFSA has built upon our array of existing trauma-informed workforce trainings to enhance curricula for CFSA staff and create new training modules for external EBP service provider staff (see Section 6: Child Welfare Workforce Training) to ensure all of DC’s child welfare workforce and partner agencies and organizations are equipped with the tools they need to effectively serve children and their families under Family First.

# Qualified Workforce

CFSA Staff. CFSA currently employs one of the most highly skilled and credentialed child welfare workforces in the country with licensed Master of Social Work comprising all CFSA caseworkers. As a result, CFSA staff are well positioned to effectively learn and carry out new practices associated with Family First, building on existing relevant expertise. All CFSA Social workers must have a master’s degree in social work from an accredited college and licensing certification from the DC Board of Social Work examiners.105 In order to advance to supervisory positions, social workers must obtain a licensed clinical social worker certification from the Board and have a minimum of two years of experience in the field of child welfare. CFSA expects all employees and contracted foster care provider staff to participate in 80 hours106 of pre-service and ongoing in-service trainings to maintain licensure and provide quality services to children and families. New CFSA social workers go through 30 full days of pre-service training. In addition to pre-service trainings, all CFSA social workers are required to complete thirty (30) hours of in-service training each year. CFSA social work supervisors are required to complete twenty-

PUTTING FAMILIES FIRST IN DC - CFSA’S FIVE YEAR PREVENTION PLAN

four (24) hours of in-service training each year.

# EBP Providers: Definition of “Qualified Clinician.”

As noted above, EBPs will be delivered by CFSA, sister agency, and Collaborative staff. All services selected as part of our five-year plan have been selected due to their high level of research evidence as well as accessibility and local support within DC (see Service Selection section above). The EBPs selected each have their own unique staff qualifications and training requirements specific to the intervention’s service delivery model. CFSA expects all providers of EBPs working with CFSA families as part of this five-year plan to uphold the staffing and training requirements specified by each EBP model. CFSA will hold all EBP service providers accountable to implementing each intervention to fidelity, including requirements of staff training and fidelity monitoring (noted in our evaluation plan). All mental health and substance abuse EBPs proposed in this plan require that all or most therapists possess a master’s degree or equivalent, and CFSA will ensure that providers meet requirements.

# DHS Staff and CBO Providers.

The DHS workforce consists of dedicated human service professionals that are trained to provide continuous support and enrichment to individuals, children, and families with the goal of promoting connection to stable housing. DHS staff and CBO providers currently benefit from access to a comprehensive range of training and receive individual training plans to ensure a high standard of expertise across the board. These training modules encompass trauma-informed care, mandated reporter training and protocols, understanding specific populations’ needs, and cultural competence and sensitivity. In addition, DHS case managers undergo specialized training in multi-agency unified case planning, child development, mental health first aid, and non-violent crisis intervention, which equips them with the necessary skills to effectively engage with and support families and their children who may be at risk for foster care agency involvement. Please see Appendix C for an overview of training topics offered to DHS staff and CBO providers.

Ongoing support and additional training from CFSA’s Child Welfare Training Academy will ensure that DHS staff are well-equipped to provide effective and compassionate services to prevention-eligible children and their families.

# A Rich History of Trauma-Informed Practice

CFSA offers robust training in trauma-informed practice to all staff, from leadership to caseworkers, through pre-service and in-service trainings, and supports trauma-informed practice through the administration of trauma-focused assessment tools with all cases. This strong foundation in trauma-informed practice ensures that CFSA’s Family First EBPs will “be provided under an organizational structure and treatment framework that involves understanding, recognizing, and responding to the effects of all types of trauma,” per the requirements of the legislation.¹⁰⁷

As noted in Section 2, CFSA’s Trauma Grant was used to make trauma-informed treatment the foundation of serving children and youth in the District’s child welfare system. As part of this work, in

PUTTING FAMILIES FIRST IN DC - CFSA’S FIVE YEAR PREVENTION PLAN

2015, CFSA integrated a series of functional assessments and screening tools into our case management practice and system of record (FACES). These tools included the Caregivers Strength and Barriers Assessment (CSBA) for adult caregivers and the CAFAS/PECFAS functional assessment for children and youth in foster care. The CSBA is designed to ensure each caregiver’s strengths and barriers are being assessed and the CAFAS/PECFAS are designed to provide an age-appropriate assessment of each child’s needs, speak to the trauma a child may be experiencing, and assess what services may need to be put in place to support each child. The CSBA was implemented agency-wide at CFSA as well as with our foster care providers, and our Collaborative community-based prevention partners. The CAFAS/PECFAS was implemented for children in foster care with CFSA as well as foster care provider staff.

This system-wide training and implementation of a trauma-informed functional assessments was coupled with a simultaneous integration of these tools into our SACWIS system (FACES). Incorporation of these tools into staff’s daily work in FACES has grounded CFSA’s social work practice in the trauma-informed and data driven decision making necessary to develop comprehensive case planning documents to support children and parents while engaged with CFSA, and after, when connected to community-based supports provided by the Collaboratives and other organizations. Under Family First, CFSA has continued to use these functional assessments to craft trauma-informed Child-Specific Prevention Plans and link to evidence-based services for candidate children and their families.

Trauma training begins the day a new hire walks through the door at CFSA to attend pre-service training and continues with in-service training throughout the year. As part our ongoing work to support and enhance our child welfare workforce, CFSA continues to implement our Practice Guidance on Resilience, Adversity & Trauma (PGRAT) series for all staff. Developed in 2016, the CWTA, in partnership with CFSA’s Office of Well Being, designed PGRAT to build upon the system-wide trainings and deepen child welfare practice through the use our robust trauma-informed training curriculum for all CFSA staff and our foster care providers. The PGRAT trainings include (1) Review of scholarly materials and participation in book reviews, (2) Engagement in facilitator-led group workshops and ongoing supervisor-facilitated teaming; and (3) Developing and enhancing trauma informed engagement, assessment, and case plan integration skills.¹⁰⁸

Trauma Informed Service Delivery for EBP Providers. Many of the EBPs selected as part of this five-year plan already incorporate trauma-informed service delivery in their model design.¹⁰⁹ As part of the procurement process, CFSA will specify the requirements needed to incorporate trauma-informed service delivery into all Family First EBP services. Where CFSA is partnering with sister agencies to deliver existing EBPs already in place, Memorandums of Understanding will be drafted to require staff receive trauma-informed service delivery training from CFSA’s CWTA. All contracts CFSA negotiates for the provision of direct EBP services will include language requiring program staff receive trauma-informed service delivery training from CFSA’s CWTA. CFSA will make this newly required trauma-informed service delivery training available, as one of the new Family First EBP Provider Training Requirements for all.

108 PGRAT Modules developed in 2016 to deepen Trauma Grant practice. PGRAT serves as the foundation for all trauma-informed trainings. Currently CWTA is in process of infusing PGRAT into all pre-service/in-service trainings.

PUTTING FAMILIES FIRST IN DC - CFSA’S FIVE YEAR PREVENTION PLAN

# Section 6: Child Welfare Workforce Training

The following section outlines the trainings that CFSA currently offers and will tailor over the coming months to provide training and support to all CFSA, DHS, and related CBO providers developing and managing Prevention Plans, assessing risk, assessing child and family needs comprehensively, connecting families to services and coordinating with existing services, knowing how to access and deliver the needed trauma-informed and evidence-based services, and overseeing and evaluating the continuing appropriateness of services. The addition of new training modules outlined below and the need for expansion of existing training offerings across the Child and Family Well-Being System will require additional CWTA staff to ensure timely and effective training to all CFSA staff, DHS and related CBO staff, sister agency partners, and EBP service providers outlined in this plan. Additional staffing requirements will be determined as CFSA begins implementation planning to incorporate the training offerings for DHS staff and related CBOs.

# Training to Develop Appropriate Child-Specific Prevention Plans

CFSA’s CWTA currently provides CFSA social workers, and foster care provider staff, and partners with a robust suite of pre-service and in-service trainings to utilize both safety (Danger and Safety) and risk assessment (Structured Decision-Making tool) outcomes and comprehensive functional assessments (CSBA and CAFAS/PECFAS), as applicable, to develop comprehensive case and service plans. CWTA works with CFSA Program staff and our Child Information Services Administration (CISA) to modify existing trainings and corresponding technology (Child Welfare Workforce Training section) to incorporate and update the formal documentation of a Family First prevention-eligible child’s Prevention Plan within FACES, CFSA’s system of record (as noted in the Prevention Plan section above) as needed. In addition to this baseline curriculum, CWTA has developed a specific set of trainings to support CFSA’s community-based Collaborative partners with all aspects of Prevention Plan management and monitoring and will also be relevant for DHS staff and related CBOs (see Training to Conduct Risk Assessments below).

# Training to Conduct Risk Assessments

As noted in the Safety and Risk Assessment section above, CFSA currently provides CFSA Social Workers and foster care provider staff with a robust suite of pre-service and in-service trainings on CSFA’s safety and risk assessments, developing comprehensive case plans and making appropriate trauma-informed service recommendations. With the implementation of the new documentation requirements outlined in the Family First legislation, CFSA has modified the existing staff trainings and developed EBP provider-specific trainings to incorporate direct service training and overall awareness of:

- How to use safety, risk, and functional assessments to document a Child-Specific Prevention Plan (documentation requirements described in the Prevention Plan section above).
- How to conduct ongoing safety and risk assessment (See Safety and Risk Assessments Section for requirements).
- The process and tools required for making updates or changes to a child’s Prevention Plan.

Training to monitor ongoing safety and risk was developed by CFSA’s CWTA and is required of all CFSA.

# PUTTING FAMILIES FIRST IN DC - CFSA’S FIVE YEAR PREVENTION PLAN

staff, Collaborative staff, DHS staff and related CBOs, and EBP providers as part of Family First. CWTA created a training specifically for the Collaborative partners which will also be provided to DHS. This training offers experiential learning and provides:

- An understanding of how the Family First Prevention Act of 2018 and Families First DC Initiative are integrated into daily practice;
- Clinical skills and assessment tools to promote child safety and family well-being;
- An explanation of the similarities and differences between risk and danger;
- An understanding of all duties and responsibilities associated with mandated reporting;
- Identification of evidence-based services and family and community supports.

# Assessing Safety and Risk

All CFSA social workers, foster care provider staff, and partners are trained to complete formal and informal safety and risk assessments, as noted in the Safety and Risk Assessment section. For CFSA social workers, these initial safety and risk assessments are captured in FACES and provide a basis for safety planning activities as needed to support a child and their family. Collaborative, DHS, and partner organization staff will be trained by CWTA to capture information about assessment findings in their systems of record and update child-specific Prevention Plans accordingly.

# Assessing Service Needs

As noted above, CWTA trains all CFSA social workers, foster care provider staff, and partners to complete the trauma informed CSBA for adult caregivers, in addition to training CFSA and provider staff to complete the CAFAS/PECFAS functional assessments for children and youth in foster care. These assessments provide a comprehensive assessment of both the parent’s and child’s specific needs and form the foundation for recommended service interventions to meet those specific needs. As part of the PGRAT training curriculum, CWTA trains workers to integrate functional assessments and screening tools into current case, service planning, and prevention planning activities to support children and families with the specific interventions needed to meet their needs.

# Connecting to the families served, Coordinating and Accessing Trauma-Informed and Evidence-Based Services

One of the key tenets of CFSA’s Family First prevention strategy is facilitating appropriate referrals to evidence-based services, which is in alignment with CFSA’s existing overall approach to service delivery, as noted in our 2018 CFSA Practice Model, detailing six core practice actions. Once CFSA staff confirm Family First eligibility and create a Child-Specific Prevention Plan, facilitating successful connections and coordinating with any other child and family services to provide, often intensive services, will be critical to a family’s engagement. To that end, CFSA will provide CFSA Collaborative, DHS and related CBO staff with training and informational materials on each EBP, ensuring that they are equipped to select the best possible EBP for each family. In addition, CFSA continues to develop technology to support trauma-informed data-driven referral recommendations and will train all staff to use new EBP and community services referral recommendation and tracking tools as they become available. CFSA will also train all CFSA, Collaborative, DHS and related CBO case managers in MI, with the goal of increasing families’ motivation to change and reach case goals, thereby increasing engagement, uptake, and completion of services.

PUTTING FAMILIES FIRST IN DC - CFSA’S FIVE YEAR PREVENTION PLAN

and related CBO staff will all be trained to provide families with Motivational Interviewing (MI) as an EBP service as an integral part of all case management activities. MI is expected to bolster family motivation to make difficult changes and to promote increased engagement, uptake, and completion of services. Motivational Interviewing does not require that staff hold a specific degree/credential to provide the service, making training on, and provision of MI a strong fit for the District’s child welfare system. While CFSA’s social workers are master’s level social workers who are required to maintain their social work licenses in good standing, the Collaboratives’ direct service staff, DHS staff, and related CBOs all have varied educational backgrounds and credential requirements.¹¹²

Lyssn provides CFSA an easy-to-scale way to deliver Motivational Interviewing training to CFSA, DHS, and Collaborative staff. CFSA, Collaborative, DHS, and related CBO supervisors will routinely provide case managers with individualized coaching on MI practice as part of the model’s ongoing fidelity monitoring processes. Lyssn data allows the CFSA EDA team to create ongoing (quarterly) fidelity monitoring reports that can be used to inform coaching and skill development needs. CFSA’s CWTA team will develop customized trainings tailored to the specific needs of CFSA, Collaborative, and DHS and related CBO staff to bolster MI fidelity.

Oversee and Evaluation the Continuing appropriateness of the services. Once a family is connected to EBP services in the community, CFSA staff, Collaboratives, DHS and related CBOs, and EBP providers are responsible for evaluating the ongoing appropriateness of fit of the referral, assessing ongoing safety and risk, and determining if modifications to a child’s Prevention Plan are needed to support child and caregiver well-being. CWTA has developed a Family First specific training, in partnership with CFSA program staff and CISA, that builds upon existing training curriculum and ensures community based EBP providers are effectively assessing risk and documenting ongoing service needs.

The Collaboratives play a key role in facilitating and coordinating services for children and families that no longer have an open case with CFSA and ensuring services and programs specified in the child’s Prevention Plan are coordinated with all other child and family services across the District. DHS and their CBO staff who oversee Child Specific Prevention Plans will play a critical role in facilitating and coordinating services for children and families to meet their housing stabilization needs and ensure services and programs specified in the Child Specific Prevention Plan are coordinated with all other child and family services across the District.

# Family First EBP Provider Training Requirements

As noted in the Training to Conduct Risk Assessments section outlined above, CFSA’s leaned on the wealth of existing trainings already built into pre-service and in-service training curriculum to create, in partnership with CFSA’s CWTA, CISA, and Program staff, three new trainings (see EBP Provider Training Curriculum (Outline) below) and offer our existing trauma-informed service delivery training to form a complete suite of EBP provider trainings to ensure appropriate trauma-informed, evidence-based services are provided to all Family First prevention-eligible children and their caregivers. Trainings build upon and incorporate the following CWTA Training Courses (as appropriate):

112 Motivational interviewing has been proven robustly effective (well-supported) without any requirement that staff hold a specific degree/credential to provide the service.

# Section 7: Prevention Caseloads

As described in the Section 1, all CFSA social workers within CFSA’s case-carrying administrations may work with Family First prevention-eligible children and caregivers (as defined within Table 1). For the purposes of this five-year plan, all CFSA social workers, Collaborative caseworkers, and DHS staff and related CBO providers are considered Prevention Caseworkers. CFSA maintains strict case load standards for all CFSA social workers based on historic alignment with agency practice needs and legal oversight. The current caseloads ratios for all CFSA social workers are as follows:

| CFSA Worker            | Caseload Standard        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| In-home social workers | 1:15 families (max 1:18) |

All case load standards above apply to both CFSA and private agency staff providing these services on behalf of the agency (foster care providers). CFSA regularly oversees and monitors caseload standards through ongoing CQI practices as well as regular agency-wide performance monitoring activities using FACES reports. CFSA program managers and social work supervisors are responsible for ensuring compliance through ongoing review and monitoring of caseload size and distribution.

CFSA’s community-based prevention providers also include EBP services provided by the Collaboratives. Collaborative case load size and type are determined and monitored through contract agreements based on CFSA’s assessed service needs with each Collaborative organization by CFSA’s Four Pillar (see Introduction) case-types follows:

| Collaborative Case Type | Caseload Standard |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Front Yard              | 1:15 families     |
| Front Porch             | 1:15 families     |
| Front Door              | 1:30 families     |

DHS and related Community Based Organization (CBO) providers across the Homeless Services Continuum of Care (CoC) utilize the following caseload standards:

| DHS CoC Prevention Providers | Caseload Standard |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Homeless Prevention Program  | 1:36 families     |
| Short Term Family Housing    | 1:13 families     |

# Appendix B: DC Child and Family Services Agency Analysis of Revenue Barriers within Family First Prevention Services Act (FFPSA, or the Act) Guidance

# Pre-print Section 2

# Introduction:

During CFSA’s analysis of the FFPSA regulatory implementation requirements outlined in ACYF-CB-PI-18-09, we recognized that some of the requirements related to prevention program financing and federal reimbursement appear to impede the District of Columbia (as a Medicaid expansion state) from maximizing (or maybe even leveraging at all) the available title IV-E prevention services funding that has been made available through the Act. The requirements in question are those in:

- Section C [Prevention Services paragraph], stating that “At least 50% of the [IV-E] funds expended by the state for prevention services in any [fiscal year] must be for services that meet the “well-supported” practice criteria; and,
- Section I [Payer of last resort], stating that “if public or private program providers (such as private health insurance or Medicaid) would pay for a service allowable under the title IV-E prevention program, those providers have the responsibility to pay for these services before the title IV-E agency would be required to pay.”

The District of Columbia already supports a diverse mix of promising, supported, and well-supported prevention programs, and our intention is to harness our existing capacity of Evidence-based Practices (EBPs) to target candidates for foster care and pregnant and parenting youth who are already in care, and to leverage available title IV-E funding to maximize the reach and impact of those programs on those populations. The guidance in the PI, however, seems to minimize our ability to do so.

# I. Summary of the Issue

Our FFPSA implementation planning has involved working with sister agencies and community partners to complete an “environmental scan” of the prevention programs, and we were pleased that a number of the prevention programs currently deployed in the District are EBPs that are among the first services selected for systematic review for the federal Clearinghouse. Many of them have already been rigorously evaluated and are well-supported EBPs, and as a result they have been approved in the District as Medicaid allowable services. Under the Payer of last resort requirement, therefore, title IV-E funding is unavailable for those services.

In concert with the Section C requirement that required 50% of IV-E spending be for well-supported EBPs, the Payer of last resort requirement becomes problematic in DC. We anticipate that the majority of the well-supported EBPs that we plan on including in our Title IV-E State five year prevention program plan will be funded through Medicaid. Conversely, most if not all of the promising and supported programs will be funded with local dollars to be matched to title IV-E reimbursement. Removing the Medicaid funded EBPs from the overall calculation of dollars expended on prevention programming leaves us with a potentially

large local spending imbalance tilted toward promising and supported programs. Because at least 50% of our IV-E spending has to be on well-supported programs, our IV-E reimbursement for the entire continuum of prevention spending will be significantly limited with respect to what the FFPSA intended. The table below illustrates how we believe the tension between these requirements adversely impacts Medicaid expansion states (like DC).

* Shaded cells indicate that the program is Medicaid funded in that state. The example above depicts three figurative states with varying levels of Medicaid “coverage”. Each state’s overall spending across all EBPs is evenly split: 50% to a combination of promising and supported EBPs and then 50% ($600) to well-supported EBPs. The only difference among them is the extent to which well-supported programs are funded through the Medicaid program. In states with Medicaid expansion, like DC, the majority of well-supported EBPs are Medicaid-funded. Column m. above is the key area of focus; it represents the local investment that would be “left on the table” and unmatched to IV-E because it exceeds the Section C spending requirement. Medicaid restricted states would be able to optimize title IV-E funding as the FFPSA intended due to the high level of unmatched local investment across the entire continuum of EBPs. Expansion states, on the other hand, won’t be able to optimize IV-E funding for the entire spectrum of prevention programs because there is not enough (per the Section C requirement) unencumbered local spending on well-supported programs; expansion states effectively get penalized for having a wider array of Medicaid covered services than their counterparts with more restrictive Medicaid coverage.

# II. Potential Remedy/Solution

The most straightforward solution would be for the Children’s Bureau to clarify in Section C such that the requirement around prevention spending on well-supported EBPs be 50% of all spending (inclusive of spending that is reimbursed through other programs or payers, such as Medicaid). Programs included in the Title IV-E State five year prevention program plan that could be reimbursable through another public or private source should be included in the calculation, such that if 50% of the state’s combined spending for all prevention program were directed toward well-supported EBPs, then the state would be able to leverage title IV-E prevention dollars to support local investment in promising or well-supported programs.
