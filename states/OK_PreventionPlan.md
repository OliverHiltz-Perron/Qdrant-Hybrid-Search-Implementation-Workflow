# SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION

Oklahoma Human Services (OKDHS) is the state agency designated to administer Title IV-B and Title IV-E programs, the Child Abuse and Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), and the Chafee Foster Care Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood as well as the federal safety net programs. OKDHS, an umbrella agency, was established by the state legislature in 1936. Support programs and services that are currently provided statewide in 77 county offices include Child Welfare Services (CWS), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid (SoonerCare), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Aging Services (AS), Developmental Disabilities Services (DDS), Child Care Services (CCS), and Child Support Services (CSS).

CWS is the OKDHS division responsible for administering the state's child welfare (CW) services and operates under the direction of CWS Director Deborah Shropshire, M.D. The CWS Director reports directly to the OKDHS Director, who reports directly to the Governor's Office.

OKDHS's mission is to improve the quality of life of vulnerable Oklahomans by improving people's ability to lead safer, healthier, more independent, and productive lives. OKDHS provides help and offers hope to vulnerable Oklahomans through stronger practices, involved communities, and a caring and engaged workforce. CWS' purpose is to improve the safety, permanency, and well-being of children and families involved in the CW system through collaboration with families and their communities. CWS' vision is to promote strong Oklahoma families together.

In order to achieve this mission and vision, CWS, together in partnership with stakeholders, must strengthen families and prevent child maltreatment and family separation and trauma to children and their parents. Reaching children and families sooner through prevention is the key to avoiding trauma, disrupting intergenerational cycles of maltreatment, and achieving better outcomes for children and families. With the continued rise in illicit and prescription drug use in Oklahoma, at least one in three children enters foster care because of parental drug abuse. An increasing number of them are infants and toddlers; last year, half of the children who entered foster care were younger than 5 years of age. A number of other factors can also disrupt a family to the point where removal is the only way to ensure a child's safety, including alcohol abuse, incarceration, parental history of trauma and abuse, financial strains from unemployment or homelessness, extreme anger and frustration, or the lack of physical care and attention. The impacts of maltreatment are costly and long lasting.

The safety and well-being of children and of all family members is paramount. When safety can be ensured, strengthening and preserving families is the best way to promote the healthy development of children. Strengthening programs and services that are designed to achieve measurable outcomes focused on prevention and protection to prevent maltreatment and the removal of children from their families and placement into foster care will improve the safety, permanency, and well-being of children and families.

OKDHS is working towards a goal of redefining what it means to be a public human service organization. This involves drastically altering how the agency shows up within the community. OKDHS is dedicated to changing the public's perception of the organization to one that is creative, innovative, and focused on deconstructing systemic barriers which prevent us from serving where and when we are needed--before families are in crisis. Leadership is committed to finding pathways to come alongside communities to identify creative ways to serve and invest in meeting unique needs as defined by the communities themselves. This involves everything from how OKDHS designs service delivery with an intentional inclusion of client voice/human-centered design, where we are physically located in service to families, and to how we leverage opportunities to blend funding sources.

Oklahoma invested a great deal of resources to safely reduce the number of children entering foster care, a trend that has resulted in a 30 percent decline over a six-year time period. This decline is the direct result of strategies aimed at serving families preventatively and those designed to reduce barriers to reaching permanency. The selection of, and sequencing of, strategies to be deployed over the next several years will be critical to continuing this momentum. As a state ranked 45th in the nation for child well-being according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation Kids Count 2020 and also among the states with the highest levels of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) according to several national data points, we as Oklahomans stand together in our relentless pursuit of change. Oklahoma's collective efforts are focused on preventing ACEs from occurring, and where trauma has occurred, utilizing the science of hope and trauma-informed practices as tools to elevate hope and promote resiliency and well-being. We are committed to creating a hope-centered, trauma-informed child and family well-being network.

For Family First Prevention Services Act ("Family First") to be truly effective and transformative, services and treatment must be culturally-relevant, community-based, and accessible to children and families. These services must be aligned with an integrated, broader prevention continuum, sufficient to keep children safe and to meet the children's and families' needs. Agency capacity to serve children and families for whom prevention services are needed will be increased through:

- strong family-centered practices that focus on understanding and treating safety needs, trauma, and strengthening parental protective capacities;
- a hope-centered, trauma-informed systems approach;
- training and structured and supportive supervision; and
- system transformation to a child and family well-being network.

Strong family-centered practices and a hope-centered, trauma-informed systems approach establish the direction, expectations, and values from which the workforce will operate, thus resulting in more empowered employees. CWS envisions this will lead to better outcomes for children and families and a stronger and better-aligned workforce, a greater degree of internal and external collaboration, and greater service flexibility and innovation. Further, community capacity will be increased by capitalizing on partnerships.

to meet child and family needs through availability of effective services. Evidence-based services will be identified and/or developed at a community level to promote child well-being, safety, and permanency, and enhance the service array.

The goals, objectives, and strategies outlined in the Oklahoma Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan, through a CW system focusing on trauma-informed, prevention-based care, will ensure the practice, procedures, and policies in place will continue to be enhanced and create sustainable, desired outcomes for Oklahoma children and families. (See Appendix A. Oklahoma Family First).

Regular, timely, and useful feedback will support successful implementation and service fidelity, as well as contribute to the developing knowledge base about successful strategies for adopting, installing, implementing, and providing access to and sustaining evidence-based prevention services to children and families in the CW system. This approach will contribute to a continuum of prevention supports and services for ensuring strong and healthy well-being of children and strengthening families with an aim of diverting families from the CW system and creating a system where all families can thrive.

OKDHS continues to make a comprehensive and systematic transformation of the CW system through strategies aimed at developing tertiary prevention services and reducing entries into foster care, as well as those designed to increase the speed of exits from foster care by improving the likelihood of reunification and reducing delays for adoption or guardianship when reunification is not possible. The IV-E Prevention Program Plan will further advance the agency's efforts toward decreasing the need for foster care as an intervention and enhance the agency's aim of becoming a hope-centered, trauma-informed organization by expanding capacity in prevention support and services for children at-risk of entering the CW system and by creating a child and family well-being network.

Strengthening parents' capacities and preventing child maltreatment requires a system of care that demonstrates commitment to helping all parents through both collective and individual supports.

Preventing child maltreatment and strengthening parental capacity requires more than a single public agency and service strategy, or even a series of targeted prevention services. A child and family well-being system of care must recognize that all parents face common challenges and that these challenges require both a collective and individual response. With the continued support of the Governor, the Legislature, and community partners, and through the implementation of the Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan, Oklahoma has an opportunity to invest in a comprehensive continuum of prevention and community-based supports and resources for children and families. In so doing, Oklahoma will transform our CW system into a child and family well-being network, in collaboration with prevention system partners, to support and strengthen safe and healthy children and families.

# Overview of Oklahoma Child Welfare System

The CWS division, a state administered CW system within OKDHS, is organized within a vertically integrated management system and operates under the direction of a CWS

Director and two assistant CWS directors, one responsible for field operations and the other responsible for program operations. The CWS Executive Team, comprised of the CWS Director, the assistant CWS directors, 10 deputy directors, and a director of clinical operations leads the state CWS division. CWS is organized into five state regions, overseen by regional deputy directors, with each providing Child Protective Services (CPS), Family-Centered Services (FCS), and Permanency Planning (PP) Services.

Another deputy director oversees Foster Care and Adoption (FC&A) services provided in all five regions, and is responsible for field staff. The 47 district directors cover 27 state districts aligned according to district attorneys' responsibilities and report to the five regional deputy directors. (See Appendix B. Regions and Districts Map). To support the critical work in the five regions, five teams, each led by a deputy director, are responsible for FC&A programs, CWS programs, CWS community partnerships, CWS finance and business, and CWS director of clinical operations (See Appendix C. CWS Organizational Chart). The deputies are responsible for CW leadership platforms, culture, structure, and models of practice that align with strategy, and improve outcomes for children and families. Middle management is responsible for key activities and processes that support implementing strategies for children and families. Middle management includes program supervisors and district directors. CW staff are responsible for daily work with children and families in alignment with strategies.

A family's entry into the CW system is through the Oklahoma OKDHS Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline (Hotline). The referrals are screened and a disposition is made as to the CPS response. CWS' purpose is to identify, treat, and prevent child abuse and neglect (CA/N) ensuring reasonable efforts are made to maintain and protect the child in the child's own home. When this is not feasible, CWS provides a placement that meets the child's needs. The infrastructure for how children and families are served in the CW system includes services administered through targeted case management (TCM) and receipt of Medicaid compensable TCM services that assist a child's access to needed medical, educational, social, and other services delivered by external partners. CW specialists are key in connecting children and families involved with the CW system with necessary prevention and intervention-related services. CWS activities are tied to the CWS Practice Model, which depicts the flow of the work from case opening to case closure.

OKDHS embarked on a CW system transformation starting in 2005 due to being one of the states with the highest number of children in foster care. CWS reshaped the focus, practice, and vision of how the agency served children and families from an "incident-based" to an "evidence-based approach," producing outcomes that support and strengthen safe and healthy children and families. CWS embarked on two processes intended to improve practice and ultimately to improve outcomes. In 2006, CWS initiated the development of a set of Practice Standards to guide the day-to-day practice of administrators, supervisors and line staff and their interaction with children, youth and their families, other social workers and the community of caregivers and providers. Following the development and yearlong implementation of the Practice Standards, CWS embarked on an effort to develop a Practice Model that embeds the practice standards and provided a framework that unified and supported the day-to-day work.

Model, which began implementation in 2008 and was fully implemented statewide in 2010, is a culture shift from child-centered to a family-centered practice. The Practice Model's foundation is the ability to identify safety threats, behaviors that need to change, and actual change in behavior. The tools and practices listed in Table 1. Practice Model Tools were created and implemented to help CW staff fully incorporate the Practice Model into their day-to-day work. Within the Practice Model there are key components that will interface with the IV-E prevention program interventions. Figure 1 illustrates the interconnection between the two processes.

# Prevention Approach

The CPS safety evaluation and investigation process is the first opportunity the CW system has direct involvement with the family to assess their strengths, identify their needs, and provide services, either directly or indirectly, to protect children and assist the family. CWS, where appropriate, identifies prevention and intervention-related services available in the community and arranges for services to be provided to the family when an assessment or investigation indicates the family would benefit from services or DHS may provide services directly. When CPS, after the completion of an assessment or investigation of CA/N allegations, determines ongoing service needs for the family requires continued direct involvement with OKDHS and the child(ren) can remain safely in the home, an FCS case is opened.

CWS emphasizes child safety and family preservation, and in the development of the Practice Standards and Practice Model there were refocused efforts on the 'front door' of CW and prevention services. In 2009, CWS developed FCS, which emphasizes a commitment to maintaining the child safely in his or her own home, when possible; focusing on the entire family rather than individuals; and providing comprehensive services that engage the family and target the family's therapeutic, supportive, and concrete needs. FCS is utilized to address the child's and family's identified safety needs, which include supports and services for families to preserve and strengthen protective capacities and to assist the family in safely caring for the child(ren) in their own home. A family who receives FCS commonly exhibits issues of parental neglect or a combination of environmental factors that are likely to result in serious harm to the child when unresolved. The risk of future maltreatment to the child, safety threats, family's protective capacities, and the level of need within the family determine the intensity of services required to address concerns within the family.

CWS administers FCS to children and families via case management (CM). The CWS CM structure and activities allow for CWS to assess the family's needs, provide ongoing CM and supports to ensure the child's continued safety, pathways to enhance family functioning, and link through referral, access to prevention and intervention-related culturally-relevant, community-based services. A referral for Oklahoma Children's Services (OCS) typically occurs in an FCS case.

OCS is a statewide, community-based, contracted services program offered through CWS, authorized by Section 1-9-110 of Title 10A of the Oklahoma Statutes (10A O.S. § 1-9-110), aimed towards the development and implementation of a diverse array of prevention and remedial community-based services and care for children who are alleged or adjudicated deprived. OCS offers services designed to help ensure and enhance the safety, well-being, and social functioning of the child and the child's family. The OCS service components currently include Comprehensive Home-Based Services (CHBS); and Parent Aide Services (PAS). CHBS utilizes the evidence-based SafeCare® model.

and CWS has provided this service, as well as other safety and prevention-related services, to families since 2009. OCS is the single largest service contract serving families whose needs encompass voluntary preventive services, reunification, services to maintain placements, and PAS. OCS has one lead agency contracted in each of the five CWS regions.

In 2012, the state started to see a significant increase in the number of children entering foster care. To address this large increase, CWS, through the resources provided within the Title IV-E Waiver Demonstration Program awarded in 2014, was afforded the opportunity to enhance the safety and prevention-related service array available for children at higher risk of entering foster care to prevent family separation and trauma to children and their parents. CWS, in partnership with the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC), developed and implemented Intensive Safety Services (ISS) intervention to target those families and children where the risk of entering foster care is higher and therefore CHBS alone was not appropriate nor meeting the needs of the families and children. This intervention was developed to complement the existing infrastructure of evidence-based prevention services (SafeCare®) and CW FCS prevention structure throughout the state.

The goal of the Title IV-E Waiver Demonstration Program was to increase the safety and well-being of children, who would otherwise be placed in foster care, thereby allowing them to remain safely in their homes. The outcomes evaluation of ISS showed the intervention to be effective at safely serving children who are at imminent risk of entering foster care by assisting with sustainable behavior changes in caregivers to eliminate or reduce the reoccurrence of CA/N and entry into foster care. Further information on the prevention services available to children and families involved with the CW system is provided in Section 4: Title IV-E Prevention Services and Oversight.

In State Fiscal Year (SFY) 20, 1,914 families/5818 children were served through FCS. CHBS and ISS continue to meet the complex needs of families being served preventively. Through resources provided through Family First, CWS will continue to increase access to prevention services for children at risk of entering the CW system through evidence-based treatment modalities.

The Family First Act provides a platform for OKDHS to reexamine how the agency as whole, and within CWS, serves and supports families, and how best to invest in a comprehensive, continuum of prevention and community-based supports and resources for children and families. The Family First Act, along with the collaboration and coordination of the Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan is helping to reshape the CW system into a child and family well-being network as part of the State's broader vision of child and family strengthening and well-being. This Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan aims to enhance efforts for better outcomes for children and families and greater service flexibility and innovation to meet the needs of children and families when they become involved with the CW system, and through continued collaborations with public health and prevention system partners develop a continuum of child and family well-being.

# SECTION 2: CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION ON A PREVENTION CONTINUUM OF CARE

More than a decade ago, Oklahoma understood that no CW agency could transform on its own. The vision outlined above reflects years of intentional investment in creating, strengthening, and refining partnerships between the CW agency and other agencies, legislators, service providers, community partners, and foundations. OKDHS continues to strengthen its ability to leverage diverse voices by strategically fostering key relationships across the network, as well as by emphasizing the significance of organically formed connections and partnerships within local communities. Governor Stitt is enacting a vision of cross-agency collaboration that involves shared goals for the people served, deconstructing barriers that prevent Oklahomans from receiving the supports they need, and innovating across sectors to leverage our combined resources. We believe commitment to collaboration and partnership, support for this unified vision across all levels of the existing system, and the resources to connect existing strategies in a meaningful way are the key elements to the transformational evolution of Oklahoma's child and family well-being network.

The appointment of a new OKDHS Director, and subsequently a new CWS Director in June 2019, shifted the agency onto a bold new path of transformation in the development of 'True North' goals which guide the agency's mission and support collaboration with our partners to serve Oklahomans together. As the state's largest agency, serving about one-third of Oklahomans annually, the opportunity to engage in the future prosperity of the state of Oklahoma is unprecedented. As the agency shifts its focus towards developing a culture of prevention, moving 'upstream' to support children and families, it is clear we cannot succeed without deep and collaborative partnerships. This past year, OKDHS deepened our relationships with many organizations, including the legislature, community organizations, tribal nations, and many local and national partners. Further, our agency worked to more intentionally serve alongside sister state agencies that impact many of the same Oklahomans. This next year will see transformation into a truly equitable organization, with these and other partners working towards safety, well-being and independence of those that we serve.

To ensure success in Family First implementation toward the CWS vision that "together we promote strong Oklahoma families" while ensuring alignment with ongoing strategies for an integrated system of care for all of Oklahoma's children and families, CWS recognized the need for oversight and management. A dedicated Family First program administrator within CWS was appointed, along with establishing partnerships with technical assistance (TA) providers, including, Casey Family Programs, purveyors of evidence-based programs, local universities, and the Capacity Building Center for States (CBCS). CWS is partnering with many different entities to successfully implement and sustain the goals and objectives set forth. Strategic and purposeful communication between CWS leadership, OKDHS leadership and collaborative partners will be imperative to ensure successful implementation of this Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan.

# External Steering Committee

The social service safety net programs offered through OKDHS exist to support families in poverty and to increase their economic opportunities by supporting basic needs, child care and job training. Strong, stable families are the cornerstone of child health and well-being, and early childhood care and education (ECCE) plays a critical role in nurturing child and family well-being. The state has long invested in the infrastructure for the creation and sustainability of a comprehensive early childhood system to ensure the long-term health, safety, well-being and educational success of the youngest Oklahomans and their families.

The Office of Child Abuse Prevention (OCAP) was created in 1984 by the Oklahoma Child Abuse Prevention (CAP) Act, Title 63, O.S. Section 1-227. The Act declared that the prevention of CA/N was a priority in Oklahoma. In accordance with the Act, the OCAP was placed within the Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) to emphasize prevention as a focus and is responsible for preparing and implementing a comprehensive State Plan for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect. OSDH also serves as the state lead responsible for administering the Community-Based Child Abuse Prevention (CBCAP) funds and providing oversight to funded programs. OSDH is the primary public health protection agency in Oklahoma that provides the kind of broad-based prevention strategies that encompass not only direct services to families, but also

includes public education efforts to change social norms and behaviors, family and community engagement, as well as the policies and institutions that help support a strong prevention system.

OCAP and CBCAP are placed within the Family Support and Prevention Services (FSPS) with the Family Health Services administration of OSDH. The FSPS promotes the health, safety, and wellness of Oklahoma's children and families by providing the infrastructure for family support and child maltreatment prevention efforts. The creation of the 2019-2023 Oklahoma State Plan for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect identified prevention strategic priorities for Oklahoma that focus on:

- Investments in evidence-based family support and CA/N prevention services, programs and resources;
- Advocate for policies that support healthy families and prevent CA/N;
- Optimize agency resources and opportunities for blended funding;
- Collaborate to ensure safe and healthy social, physical, and mental and emotional environments; and
- Educate on child development, effective parenting strategies, and CA/N.

The Oklahoma Partnership for School Readiness (OPSR) was created in 2003 by the Oklahoma Partnership for School Readiness Act, Title 10 O.S. § 640. Oklahoma recognized more state level action was required to successfully support families and children from birth to preschool. The OPSR Board, a 32-member public-private partnership, serves as Oklahoma's Early Childhood State Advisory Council, ensuring state policies are based on research, feedback from families and providers, cross-sector collaborations, and input to improve children's health and development. OPSR works to help children arrive at school with the knowledge, skills and physical and emotional health to succeed. OPSR's mission is to lead Oklahoma in coordinating an early childhood system that strengthens families and ensures all children are ready for school.

In 2018, as a national leader in ECCE, Oklahoma was awarded a federal Preschool Development Grant Birth through Five (PDG B-5) to strengthen equitable access to child care and early learning opportunities. The PDG B-5 grant provided Oklahoma an opportunity for achieving an effective and quality ECCE mixed delivery system aimed at enhancing cross-system collaboration, improving connections between existing resources, and increasing program access while maximizing parental choice. A five-year early childhood strategic plan was developed, along with an early childhood integrated data systems plan and program evaluation plan, in collaboration with CW and child abuse prevention partners to address the distinct development needs of young children at risk for and involved in the CW system.

The plan focuses on four pillars of long-term infrastructural supports necessary for sustainability: human capital, physical capital, intellectual capital, and financial capital. These pillars help the strategic plan aim for five major goals:

# HHS-ACYF-CB-Title IV-E Prevention Program

# Oklahoma Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan FFY2022-2026

1. Align systems of care to produce more seamless, high-quality and cost-effective services for families and young children;
2. Secure affordable, quality early care and education for children from birth to age three;
3. Boost choices families have for culturally responsive care and services that support parents' ability to work and family well-being;
4. Prioritize the urgent health and mental health needs of young children and their families; and
5. Communicate better with families about how to support the development and well-being of their children.

The Partnership for Infant's, Children's, Youth's, and Young Adult's Mental, Emotional and Behavioral Health (The Partnership), through a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) among all eight child-serving state agencies, was established in 2004 to ensure the creation and efficient operation of a unified and integrated system of care for all of Oklahoma's infants, children, youth, and young adults with, or at risk of, mental, emotional and behavioral disorders. The eight child-serving state agencies' directors serve on The Partnership, alongside the Directors of the Oklahoma Family Network and National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI OK), and family members, youths, and young adults to ensure the aims of the Systems of Care (SOC) network throughout the state of Oklahoma are achieved. A larger, more diverse group of stakeholders representing agencies, advocacy groups, and family members serve on the State Advisory Team (SAT) and guide the development of the SOC network's broad array and continuum of services and supports, while ensuring to uphold the values and principles of SOC.

The Children's State Advisory Workgroup (CSAW) serves as the working arm of SAT. CSAW is a collaborative, coordinating body with sustainable infrastructure and is a collaboration of leaders from child serving organizations that have mechanisms to connect and leverage resources across multiple systems. CSAW is charged to develop, enhance, coordinate, and integrate systems that assist with identification of behavioral health goals to increase hope and resilience for children and families. CSAW's vision is to increase hope in children and families by creating early and easy access to effective behavioral health support, resources, and services to remain safely and successfully in their own home and community. Additionally, CSAW was identified as a critical working group to execute shared strategies from goals created by the executive level leadership from child-serving agencies that support children, families, and communities.

Figure 4. Cross Systems Coordination Diagram illustrates the cross systems coordination within CSAW and SAT, and the relationship to the local and state agencies and communities.

In conjunction with the established SAT and CSAW, and its existing infrastructure that will be leveraged to support the broad state prevention-related strategies, the Family First External Steering Committee was formed to provide a mechanism for cross-system collaboration to provide guidance and input to the Family First-SIT on the key components of Family First. The Family First External Steering Committee is comprised of representatives from key state level agencies and community partners that guided the development of the Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan and will continue to support and ensure alignment with the overall state vision of child and family strengthening and well-being, and transformation of Oklahoma's child and family well-being network.

HHS-ACYF-CB-Title IV-E Prevention Program
# Oklahoma Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan FFY2022-2026

Oklahoma tribes. Oklahoma has 38 federally-recognized tribes and through tribal state agreements and partnership OKDHS collaborates to coordinate services and provide Title IV-E and IV-B funding. American Indian children in tribal custody are provided with services consistent with children in OKDHS foster care. The services are outlined in tribal state agreements and consists of foster care and adoption services, Oklahoma Successful Adulthood (OKSA) services, Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC), post-adoption and guardianship subsidies.

Under the direction of the OKDHS Director’s leadership an agency assigned tribal liaison is a support for the CWS division and across multiple OKDHS divisions aimed to ensure tribal collaboration and voice to promote and facilitate the co-designing of a child and family well-being network. The Tribal State Workgroup (TSW) was formed over a decade ago to provide an infrastructure for the state and tribes to strengthen partnerships and collaborate on practice improvements and Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) compliance with the CWS division. All 38 federally-recognized tribes are invited to participate in the TSW which is co-chaired by OKDHS CWS and Indian Child Welfare (ICW) leadership creating a platform in which multiple voices and perspectives are shared. The TSW is currently co-chaired by the CWS Director and Sac and Fox ICW Director and meets on a quarterly basis.

Oklahoma Pinnacle Plan, the state improvement plan from the 2012 class action lawsuit, DG vs. Yarbrough lead to the development of the CWS Tribal Program Unit consisting of a supervisor and four program field representatives, known as tribal coordinators. The Tribal Program Unit provides the tribes a direct contact with CWS ensuring ICWA compliance and enhancing partnerships with tribes. The Tribal Program Unit provides a point of contact for tribes on Family First, ensuring continued collaboration and coordination in the implementation and ongoing planning of the Title IV-E Prevention Program and services in Oklahoma. The Tribal Program Unit participates in the TSW, as well as are involved in the Oklahoma Indian Child Welfare Association (OICWA).

The OICWA originated from an ICWA Task Force created in 1981 to address common areas of service and issues among ICWA programs in the state. The ICWA Task Force evolved into the OICWA and, in 1984, was officially recognized by the state of Oklahoma as a corporation. The OICWA continues to uphold the original vision and mission of its founding members to promote the well-being of American Indian children, their families and their tribes. The OICWA comprises of a five-member board that make up the executive committee and nine other committees that include: legislative, bylaws, training, special projects, substitute care, membership, public relations, and conference. The Tribal Program Unit participates in and serves on various committees alongside tribal members.

The partnerships with tribes have further been strengthened through the Oklahoma ICWA Partnership grant awarded in 2016. The ICWA Partnership, comprised of OKDHS, OICWA, and the Court Improvement Project (CIP), was developed in 2016, as the evolution of previous partnerships, and committed to working together to strengthen

ICWA practice, with a shared, stated goal to "improve safety, permanency, and well-being of American Indian children and families through improved communication, training, and accountability of child welfare and court systems as it applies to ICWA". Three specific objectives were identified through the ICWA Partnership Grant to promote ICWA compliance and establish measurable outcomes, which include: to build or enhance relationships between state child welfare, the court system and tribes; to build or enhance ICWA compliance with clearly defined policies and procedures within state, court, and tribal systems; and building or enhancing current management information systems resulting in more timely and effective communication among tribes, state governments, and courts. For more information on the ICWA Partnership grant objectives and progress, and all consultation and coordination efforts with tribes, please see 2021 Annual Progress and Services Report (APSR), Section on Consultation and Coordination Between States and Tribes.

The intent of Family First aligns with the goals of the ICWA. It promotes transforming a CW system into a child and family well-being network that keeps children safe and meets the needs of children and families while also preserving culture, family, and community and preventing unnecessary trauma caused by the removal of children from their home.

Oklahoma leveraged the well-established partnerships through the Tribal Program Unit, the TSW, and OICWA to collaborate with tribes during the planning phase and development of the Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan. The state initially engaged tribes through the TSW and inclusion of tribal members into the established Family First planning and implementation structure within the Family First External Steering Committee, however those efforts yielded very little engagement and input to the Family First Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan.

A statewide Tribal Convening was hosted in November 2020 by the state in collaboration with members of the TSW and Casey Family Programs aimed to improve coordination and collaboration with tribes on Family First planning. The convening was a platform to share with tribes what Family First is and how it can impact tribes, and facilitate small group discussion on opportunities towards continued engagement with tribes in the planning and implementation of Family First.

This lead to the OICWA establishing a subcommittee designated for Family First to support the collaboration and coordination of creating a comprehensive continuum of prevention and community-based supports and resources for children and families that includes culturally-relevant prevention services to promote safe, health, and culturally strong environments for Native children, their families, and their tribes. The OICWA Family First subcommittee is committed to enhancing collaboration and partnership between OKDHS and OICWA, and Oklahoma tribes toward developing a child and family well-being network. The OICWA Family First subcommittee within and through the OICWA infrastructure and individual tribes will be utilized in the implementation phase and continued planning into Oklahoma’s Title IV-E Prevention Program toward a broader continuum of culturally-relevant, community-based array of prevention services and support that can meet the unique needs of Indian children, their families, and their tribes.

Oklahoma will continue to collaboratively involve the Children's Bureau and associated TA partners throughout the implementation phase to provide the opportunity for support and to facilitate a high level of collaboration to ensure the breadth of Family First is achieved. OKDHS remains committed to engaging families, youth, community partners, tribes, other state agencies, courts, and the private sector in supporting children and families. CWS has dedicated significant resources to support these partnerships and through the established Family First planning and implementation structure will ensure the management and oversight of the Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan implementation is a system-wide integration and provides a mechanism for cross-system collaboration.

that will lead to a child and family well-being network. Access to the resources, services, programs, and supportive networks to ensure safe, stable, nurturing environments for children, families, caregiver, and communities is a priority in the state of Oklahoma. OKDHS CWS, as a partner, is committed to ensuring the creation and efficient operation of a unified and integrated system of care for all Oklahomans.

A key component to successful system transformation is engagement of stakeholders and the input they provide in the improvements of the CW system. Oklahoma has secured a partnership with Foster America and resources to apply human-centered design methods to implement and institutionalize a framework and culture for inclusion of youth, family, and tribal voices to promote and facilitate the co-designing of a child and family well-being network. Oklahoma views engagement of those with lived expertise essential in developing a comprehensive prevention continuum by elevating an understanding of what families need and how to remove the barriers that prevent them from receiving effective supports and services.

As implementation moves forward, and through the established feedback loops, system review processes, and evaluation, the information gathered will be able to shed insight as to the effectiveness of the collaborations and the access and quality of services provided to children, youth, and families. The design of the implementation approach, through a system focusing on hope-centered, trauma-informed care, will ensure the policies, practices, and services put in place from the Title IV-E Prevention Program are sustainable. Although the Oklahoma CW system continues to be in a state of flux due to the driving force of system reform, the full support of the OKDHS leadership, Oklahoma legislature, and the Governor's office continues to strengthen system transformation. The very solid, already existing partnerships have established a framework for the sustainability of a comprehensive, continuum of prevention and community-based supports and resources for children and families.

For more information on the overall collaboration efforts for the CWS division, along with coordination of services under the Title IV-B plan, please see Oklahoma's 2020-2024 CFSP and 2021 Annual Progress and Services Report (APSR), Sections on Collaboration and Services.

# SECTION 3: CHILD AND FAMILY ELIGIBILITY FOR THE TITLE IV-E PREVENTION PROGRAM

During the planning phase, OKDHS, in collaboration with the identified stakeholders described above in Section 2, considered several factors that affect the Oklahoma CW system including the legal authority and scope, who and how the division already serves, and the broader prevention continuum infrastructures aimed at keeping children safe and enhancing child and family well-being in development of the Title IV-E Prevention Program eligibility. The purpose of OKDHS CWS is to improve the safety, permanency, and well-being of children and families involved in the CW system. OKDHS, through administration of the CPS program, is charged with the responsibility of investigating or assessing all accepted reports of alleged CA/N by the person responsible for the child's care; ensuring reasonable efforts are made to maintain and protect the child in the child's own home; assessing family strengths and needs, and providing services to remedy the conditions and behaviors that cause abuse, neglect, and safety threats. These factors, along with an analysis of statewide data, and in alignment with the CFSP goals and the broader Oklahoma vision of a child and family well-being network served as the basis for defining a candidate for foster care.

# Candidate Definition

OKDHS defines a candidate for foster care as "a child under age 18 at imminent risk of entering foster care, who can remain safely in his or her home or with kin caregivers with receipt of approved Title IV-E prevention services under the child's prevention plan that are necessary to prevent the child's entry into foster care". This definition is equivalent to Oklahoma's Title IV-E Foster Care program eligibility as authorized by Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, as amended, and implemented under the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 45 CFR parts 1355, 1356, and 1357 and in accordance with Oklahoma Children's Code, Title 10A of the Oklahoma Statutes, which provides the foundation and process for state intervention into the parent-child relationship whenever a family's circumstances threaten a child's safety.

Those circumstances or characteristics, as defined in the Oklahoma Children's Code, 10A O.S. §§ 1-1-105, 1-2-105, and 1-6-105; 21 O.S. §§ 748, 748.2, and 1040.13a; and in Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC) 340:75-3-120 of the child, parent, or kin caregiver that may put the child(ren) at imminent risk of entering foster care may include, but are not limited to:

- Children younger than 4 years of age
- Family behaviors, conditions, or situations
- Substance use or abuse: substance-affected and substance-exposed
- Domestic violence, including intimate partner violence
- Mental Illness
- History of child maltreatment

- Diminished protective capacity/parenting skills
- A child who is in need of special care and treatment because of his or her physical or mental condition, and the child's parents, legal guardian, or other custodian is unable or willfully fails to provide such special care and treatment.

In state fiscal year (SFY) 2019, OKDHS received 81,249 reports on families, and after screening, 36,138 reports had allegations that met the statutory CA/N definition and were within OKDHS' legal scope to investigate or assess. An investigation was completed and a finding made for 63,956 children and an assessment was completed on 1,708 children. Findings are not made for assessments. In SFY 19 of all the children on whom OKDHS completed investigations, 24 percent had a substantiated finding. A finding of substantiated means OKDHS, after an investigation of a CA/N report and based upon some credible evidence, determined that CA/N occurred. When CA/N is substantiated, OKDHS may recommend:

- court intervention when OKDHS finds the child's health, safety, or welfare is threatened; or
- CA/N prevention and intervention-related services for the child, parents, or persons responsible for the child's care when court intervention is not determined necessary.

OKDHS aims to provide maximum safety for children and to enable families to remain together, when possible. The majority of families that are identified through a report of abuse and/or neglect can be assisted through community-based services and voluntarily through OKDHS. However, in serious abuse and/or neglect, court intervention and removal of the children from their homes may be necessary.

Figure 5. Substantiated Child Abuse and Neglect by Category SFY19, depicts the categories of substantiated abuse and neglect. Neglect continues to be the highest single category of child maltreatment in Oklahoma. Children can be victims of more than one type of abuse or neglect.

| Sexual Abuse | 280   |
| ------------ | ----- |
| Abuse        | 486   |
| Neglect      | 88.4% |

The most frequent type of neglect substantiated was "threat of harm," followed by exposure to domestic violence. The "threat of harm" type captures parental substance abuse, which for Oklahoma equates to 56 percent of the reasons for children entering foster care. In Oklahoma, the number one type of substance abuse continues to be methamphetamine, followed by marijuana. This type of substance abuse greatly diminishes parental protective capacities.

that in turn adversely impacts the ability to provide ongoing protection of a child related to safety and well-being and

assessments for children based on age, gender, and primary race.² While child maltreatment is a complex problem rooted in poor relationships and environments, research has proven CA/N is preventable with effective prevention intervention strategies targeted at all levels of society that increase community, family, and individual protective factors and capacities moving toward safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments.

Over the last decade, OKDHS focused on enhancing tertiary prevention direct services for children and families, as well as CW practices toward a CW prevention-focused practice model to improve safety and well-being outcomes. These strategies include FCS enhancement through the Safety through Supervision Framework and access to prevention services such as OCS CHBS – SafeCare®, Youth Villages – Intercept®, and the implementation of the Title IV-E Waiver demonstration project – ISS.

These programmatic strategies, in alignment with goals and objectives in the OKDHS CFSP (2020-2024) and in partnership with stakeholders, continue to develop pathways to strengthen families, keep children safely in their own homes, decrease the number of family disruptions by increasing prevention efforts, prevent child maltreatment, and support Oklahoma's shared vision of a child and family well-being network. OKDHS sees Family First as an opportunity to reduce the need for foster care as an intervention, and enhance and expand prevention efforts through FCS programs with the potential to serve more families preventively, and focus on additional categories of the population and services.

Based on these guiding principles and an analysis of statewide data of key populations, OKDHS and its partners determined the following populations eligible for Oklahoma Title IV-E Prevention Program and services.

1. # Child of a substantiated allegation, determined unsafe with manageable safety threats.

This category includes a child with a substantiated allegation of abuse and/or neglect and the home is determined unsafe, but existing safety threats can be managed through a safety plan, guardianship, non-custodial parent, or court oversight. Based on the definition, this is the highest "at imminent risk of entering foster care" population. In FFY 2019, 775 unique children were part of this population and 603 children in FFY 2020. Of those children in 2019, 430 or 55 percent were between the 0 and 5 years of age and 352 or 59 percent in FFY 2020. Upon completion of the CPS safety evaluation and investigation, a finding of substantiation is made and the child's safety is assured through a safety intervention of safety planning and FCS.
2. # Child of a substantiated allegation, determined safe.

This category includes a child with a substantiated allegation of abuse and/or neglect and the home is determined safe, but the family behaviors, conditions, or situations have an "imminent risk" to manifest a threat to a child's safety and cross the safety threshold. OKDHS utilizes this measurement for determining child safety and the need for a safety intervention to prevent an unsafe child. OKDHS expects this population to average approximately 300 per year. In FFY 2019, 346 unique children were part of this population, 269 in FFY 2020. Of those children in 2019, 191 or 55 percent were between the 0 and 5 years of age and 121 or 45 percent in FFY 2020.
3. # Sibling(s) in Foster care.

This category includes a child with a sibling in foster care and the home's existing safety and risk factors can be mitigated. When safety threats result in court intervention – removal of one or more siblings from the home, those same family behaviors, conditions, or situations have an "imminent risk" to manifest a threat to the sibling(s)' safety who remained in the home and signals the need for prevention and intervention-related services to help prevent future child maltreatment and entry into foster care. OKDHS is unable to accurately identify this population to estimate the expected number to be served.
4. # A child who has been reunified.

The period following reunification is a vulnerable time for families. This includes a child reunified with his or her family following foster care and existing safety and risk factors, which would result in re-entry to foster care, can be mitigated. In FFY 2019, this population included 181 children and 169 in FFY 2020.
5. # A child in an adoption or guardianship.

This category includes a child whose adoption or guardianship arrangement is at risk of disruption or dissolution and would result in a foster care placement. These children are often part of an investigation with an "imminent risk" for removal based on prior foster care placement and their trauma history signals the need for prevention and intervention-related services to help prevent future child maltreatment and entry into foster care. In FFY 2019, this population included 228 children with a substantiated allegation of abuse and/or neglect and the home determined unsafe, 183 children in FFY 2020.

# Candidate Identification

As Figure 1 illustrated, initial reports of abuse and/or neglect are made to the centralized OKDHS Hotline. Each report received at the Hotline is screened through the standardized intake process to determine whether the allegations meet the definition of child abuse or neglect and are within the scope of CPS assessment or investigation, per Oklahoma Children's Code, 10A O.S. §§ 1-1-101 et seq. and OAC 340:75-3. CPS intervention is limited to current situations as the CPS focus is on identifying and protecting children presently at risk or who will be at risk when safety measures are not put in place. When a report is received that is not appropriate for CPS, however, services are needed, CPS may make a referral to another OKDHS division or an outside resource for emergency food, shelter, medical services, or counseling. OKDHS responds to an accepted report of abuse or neglect by initiating the CPS safety evaluation and investigation process.

The CPS safety evaluation and investigation process is the manner in which CW specialists gain information surrounding six key questions from the family to assess their strengths, identify their needs, and provide services, either directly or indirectly, that protects children and assists the family. The Assessment of Child Safety (AOCS) tool formal documents the AOCS process which identifies and articulates:

- Safety information gathered through the six key questions;
- The protective capacities of the parents and how they impact child safety;
- The presence or absence of safety threats as measured against the five areas of the safety threshold; and
- The safety decision and level of intervention.

The safety evaluation process allows for the most accurate safety decision possible and determination of the most appropriate level of intervention. As part of the safety evaluation, OKDHS utilizes the Safety Threshold for determining child safety and if a safety threat exists. The five safety threshold areas are:

- Observable – family behaviors, conditions, or situations representing a danger to a child that are specific, definite, real, can be seen and understood, and are subject to being reported and justified;
- Vulnerable child – a child who is dependent on others for protection and is exposed to circumstance that he/she is powerless to manage, and susceptible, accessible, and available to a threatening person and/or person in authority over them;
- Out-of-control – family behavior, conditions, or situations that are unrestrained resulting in an unpredictable and possible chaotic family environment which is not subject to influence, manipulation, or ability within the family's control;
- Imminent – the belief that dangerous family behaviors, conditions, or situation will remain active or become active in the near future;

# HHS-ACYF-CB-Title IV-E Prevention Program

# Oklahoma Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan FFY2022-2026

• severity – the effects of maltreatment that have already occurred and/or the potential for harsh effects based on a child's vulnerability and the family's behavior, condition, or situation that is out-of-control.

When behaviors cross all five areas of the safety threshold, a child is unsafe and a safety intervention is required; the intervention is aimed at being the least-restrictive, least-intrusive one that ensures the child is safe. A safety plan is implemented when: a child is determined unsafe and court-ordered removal of the child from the home is not requested; present and/or impending danger is identified; and the family agrees to collaborate with OKDHS to control and manage identified safety threats. A safety plan is developed to control and manage the safety threats while the child remains in the home or while the child temporarily stays in an alternative location outside of the home. When OKDHS and the parent agree to utilize a safety plan, a Family Service Agreement (FSA)/Safety Plan3 is completed to document the parent's acceptance of CW services and intervention to assist the family to safely care for the child, the parent's agreement to participate in FCS, and initial identification of services.

These described CPS safety evaluation and investigation processes will support the identification of candidates and the need for Family First prevention services in Oklahoma. When it is determined the child meets the candidacy definition, an FCS (prevention service) case will be opened. The date candidacy determination is made will be documented in the KIDS system, OKDHS CWS Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System (CCWIS), at the time the FSA is signed and an FCS case is opened. Following CPS assessment and investigation completion and the candidacy determination is made, the case will be transferred to an FCS specialist.

# Identification of pregnant and parenting youth

OKDHS currently has some methods for identifying pregnant and parenting youth in foster care. However, enhancements to the state's CCWIS system are currently underway to assist with more accurate identification of this population. In FFY 2019, 58 unique youth were part of this population, 36 in FFY 2020.

# Prevention Plan for the Child

A Child Safety Meeting (CSM), which is held anytime a child's safety condition warrants consideration of a safety intervention by moving a child, having a parent leave the home, or having a monitor move in or monitor the home, is utilized during the CPS safety evaluation and investigation process and in opening an FCS case for safety and placement-related decisions. The CSM will serve as the initial meeting with the family to establish a safety plan and service provision. The FSA will serve as the child's prevention plan by documenting the child's IV-E prevention eligibility through candidacy, the foster

Care prevention strategy, and initial identification of IV-E prevention services based upon the recommendations of the CPS specialist. The date of the signed FSA will indicate the IV-E Prevention Plan start date. The FSA is an existing document utilized by CWS that will be revised for this purpose in an effort to streamline the planning processes and documents to reduce the burden on families and staff. The CPS AOCS and CSM aid in identification of the foster care prevention strategy and services with the family. When a CSM is not required, but it is determined the child meets the definition of candidacy, a family meeting (FM) is held to assist in identification of the foster care prevention strategy and services with the family and the FSA is completed. The referral and start date for Title IV-E prevention services, and end date upon completion of services, will be captured and documented in the KIDS system, per OAC 340:75-1-151.

Upon acceptance of CW services and intervention and participation in a FCS case through a signed FSA, the case is transferred from CPS to an FCS specialist and an FM will be held to collaboratively create an Individualized Service Plan (ISP) that effectively addresses the child's safety, permanency and well-being. The CPS AOCS, FSA, ongoing AOCS, along with input from the child and family team will help in the ISP development and referring the parents or kin caregivers to the most appropriate services that will elicit behavioral change. The ISP documents:

- The interventions needed to correct the conditions that result in CW involvement;
- A course of action to be taken by the CW specialist and family to achieve the planned changes;
- Services associated with specific outcomes available to the child and parents or kin caregivers;
- The behaviors and conditions that require change;
- Specific measures to facilitate family change;
- The time requirements for the family, CW specialist, and other providers to complete the action steps;
- The alternative plan in the event protective capacities are not enhanced and the parent or kin caregiver is unable to manage the safety threats;
- The expected length of time services are needed in the case; and
- A crisis management plan to address contingencies, such as a parent's relapse or regression, domestic violence, or environmental or other emergent conditions.

The Title IV-E prevention services will be incorporated into the ISP and work in tandem with the other services listed in the ISP toward progress in correcting the behaviors and conditions that created the safety threats, increasing protective capacities, and ensuring the child's safety. The FCS specialist will provide support to the family, referrals for services, and oversight of prevention services while the family works with OKDHS to eliminate safety threats and improve parental protective capacities. The FCS specialist ensures the child's safety and monitors case plan progress through FCS specialist contacts with the child, parent or kin caregiver, and service providers per OAC 340:75-4-12.1. The monitoring and oversight of a child's safety while receiving IV-E prevention services and reexamination of the child's prevention plan will be further described in Section 6: Monitoring Child Safety.

Prevention plan for pregnant and parenting youth. The IV-E prevention plan for a pregnant or parenting foster youth will be captured in Form 04KI005E, Child's Individualized Service Plan (ISP)4. The ISP is an existing document utilized by CWS that is completed when any child is initially removed and updated when subsequent changes or a change of placement occurs, per 10A O. S. § 1-4-704. The Child's ISP is completed within 30-calendar days of a child's initial removal and placement, and updated within 14-calendar days when subsequent changes or a change of placement occurs, excluding a child returning to his or her own home or a shelter, per OAC 340: 75-6-40.1 ITS.

The Child's ISP will be used for the prevention plan for pregnant and parenting youth in foster care to streamline the planning processes and documents to reduce the burden on families and staff. The permanency planning (PP) specialist will complete the ISP with the Title IV-E prevention services to be provided to, or on behalf of, the youth to ensure that the youth is prepared or able to be a parent, and will identify the foster care prevention strategy for any child born to the youth. The ISP is entered into the KIDS system and filed with the court in conjunction with the family ISP. The date the ISP is completed will indicate the Title IV-E Prevention Plan start date for the pregnant or parenting foster youth.

The referral and start date for Title IV-E prevention services, and end date upon completion of services, will be captured and documented in the KIDS system, per OAC 340:75-1-151. The PP specialist will provide support to the youth, any child born to the youth, and family, referrals for services, and oversight of prevention services while the family works with OKDHS to eliminate safety threats and improve parental protective capacities, along with ensuring the youth is prepared or able to be a parent.

The PP specialist ensures the youth’s safety, and any child born to the youth, and monitors case plan progress through PP specialist contacts with the youth, parent or kin caregiver, and service, per OAC 340:75-6-48. The monitoring and oversight of the safety of a youth, and any child born to the youth receiving Title IV-E prevention services and reexamination of the youth's prevention plan will be further described in Section 6: Monitoring Child Safety.

# SECTION 4: TITLE IV-E PREVENTION SERVICES AND OVERSIGHT

The CWS division, through continued system transformation and enhancing of prevention practices and strategies to increase access to services as noted in the 2020-2024 CFSP, aims to further reduce the need for foster care as an intervention, as well as enhance and expand prevention efforts. OKDHS is making significant advancement toward these goals and envisions approval of this Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan and the resources provided through Family First will allow continuation and expansion of some of the existing services and the potential to serve more families preventively. Oklahoma's state-supervised and state-administered plan affords OKDHS the legal authority and scope for the entire state to be the geographic focus of the Title IV-E Prevention Program and services.

As continued cross-system collaboration and coordination with OSDH and ODMHSAS occurs and additional evidence-based practices are reviewed by the Family First Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse, OKDHS plans to expand efforts to focus on additional categories of the population and expand the service array toward an integrated prevention continuum and child and family well-being network. In addition, because Oklahoma has 38 federally-recognized tribes, OKDHS will continue to engage our tribal partners in the expansion of culturally-relevant prevention services to promote safe, healthy, and culturally strong environments for Native children, their families, and their tribes. A continuum of care and service array for children and families through a community-based approach to ensure connection to, and utilization of, the formal and informal community-based resources available is a priority in Oklahoma. Designing a network that strengthens families through the delivery of prevention services and enhancing protective factors will help decrease disparities in outcomes and create a system where all families can thrive.

When caregivers lack access to needed support and services, families can experience stress that may lead to CA/N, as well as potential long-term consequences for children. Research has identified various broad programmatic strategies that work well in strengthening families and preventing CA/N, such as home visiting, early childhood programs, family strengthening initiatives, and strategies that help families build and increase protective factors and capacities. Oklahoma recognizes home-based family support services improve the lives of families and are a cost-effective intervention compared to the costs of involvement in the CW system. The state's investment in an ECCE system through state appropriations, and increased federal investments through the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program (MIECHV Program), has helped support and sustain home visitation programs. Oklahoma provides a variety of voluntary home-based family support programs that deliver services to both expectant parents and families with children younger than six years old aimed at increasing protective factors to reduce child maltreatment, prevent family separation, and increase well-being. Oklahoma has implemented three evidence-based models of home visiting: Parents As Teachers (known as Start Right), Nurse-Family Partnership (known as

Children First), and SafeCare®-Augmented with varying levels of service intensity targeted to meet specific family needs and risk factors. These program models vary in the populations they serve, the length of time services are provided, and in the required education and experience of home visitors carrying out model activities. This statewide framework allows rural and urban communities to meet their unique needs. Home-based family support programs are delivered through OSDH, county health departments, and contractually through community-based non-profits. To maximize available resources, most services are targeted toward particular subpopulations that are most in need. These priority populations include: single mothers, low-income families, parents with low education, families with a history of substance abuse or child maltreatment, and children with developmental delays or disabilities.

This strategic framework has created an established infrastructure for a comprehensive early childhood system that supports and strengthens families, prevents child maltreatment, and ensures the long-term health, safety, well-being and educational success of the youngest Oklahomans. This infrastructure and pathways for families to receive a continuum of evidence-based primary, secondary and tertiary prevention services is illustrated in Figure 8. Oklahoma Child Abuse Prevention Network.

The Oklahoma Child Abuse Prevention Network goes beyond what Family First will provide, and includes prevention services for all children and families; those not known to the agency and those who will come to the attention of CW and be captured within the candidacy population. 5, 6 OKDHS collaborated with OSDH and prevention system partners to identify and implement strategies to support safe and healthy children and families through the creation of the Oklahoma State Plan for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect 2019-2023.7

OKDHS further collaborated with OPSR, through the support of the federal Preschool Development Grant (PDG B-5), in the creation of the five-year early childhood strategic plan with goals and objectives developed to specifically address the distinct developmental needs of young children at risk for and involved in the child welfare system and to align with the IV-E Prevention Program plan.

The newly launched Oklahoma Clearinghouse for Early Childhood Success will build upon these resources to identify and implement best practices in early care and education settings. These effective prevention strategies that are focused on modifying policies, practices, and societal norms, and when coordinated through strategic priorities and plans across state and local government and community organizations, ensure families access to the resources, services, programs and supportive networks to ensure safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments for children and prevent instances of child maltreatment.

In this first submission, OKDHS is focusing on in-home parent skill-based programs that were established within the infrastructure of the CW system, and contracted with community-based providers with an established history of serving families involved with the CW system who have experienced child maltreatment. These contracted community-based services support the promotion of health, safety and wellness of Oklahoma's children and families. OKDHS aims to not bring more families into the CW system, but rather improve prevention practices and enhance and expand the services and supports that allow for more families to be served in FCS and not within foster care.

CWS continues to utilize multiple strategies toward improving safety decision-making and increasing positive outcomes for children and families while also building capacity to accurately identify safety threats, provide appropriate services to eliminate safety threats, and improve parental protective capacities. The Oklahoma CWS Title IV-E Prevention Program and services are designed to produce change at two levels: the child and family level and the system level. The continued focus on family-centered practice improvement and a hope-centered, trauma-informed systems approach is expected to result in both.

As described in previous sections, additional in-home parent skill-based programs are available through the OSDH that provides broad-based primary prevention services. Further, Oklahoma's mental health and substance abuse services are jointly funded and administered through ODMHSAS and OHCA, the state Medicaid authority; which for the majority of children and families involved with CW are covered through Medicaid.

OKDHS, as a partner of and through The Partnership, is committed to ensuring a unified and integrated system of care for all Oklahoma's children, youth and families with or at risk for mental, behavioral, and substance abuse disorders.

Oklahoma implemented and sustained multiple well-established evidence-based programs and services available to children and families that support and strengthen safe and healthy children and families and fall within the Title IV-E prevention program and service criteria (See Appendix D. Oklahoma Service Array Matrix). However, due to a variety of reasons, including existing funding sources, rating and approval decisions or not rated yet, and state capacity to meet the evaluation requirements for any practice not rated as well-supported, Oklahoma has chosen to seek approval of only two prevention services for Family First Title IV-E prevention funding at this time. As the evidence base for programs and services in Oklahoma evolves and additional programs and services are reviewed by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse, future amendments to this plan will be considered. Additionally, over the next year the state will be implementing Medicaid expansion and Managed Care and thus OKDHS will be awaiting additional information to determine how this will influence prevention service provision.

# Oklahoma Title IV-E Prevention Services

Oklahoma is seeking approval of the following two evidence-based in-home parent skill-based prevention programs: SafeCare® and Intercept®. OKDHS already has established contracts with providers for these two services and the existing infrastructure throughout the state through OCS to provide these services to children who are identified as a candidate for foster care or pregnant and parenting foster youth and the parents and kin caregiver of those children and youth. In addition to these two in-home parent skill-based prevention programs, OKDHS will continue to contract for and sustain a third prevention service, Intensive Safety Services (ISS), which was developed and implemented through Oklahoma's Title IV-E Child Welfare Waiver Demonstration, but will not be seeking approval for Family First Title IV-E prevention funds at this time. The initial evaluation outcomes showed the intervention to be able to safely serve children who are at imminent risk of entering foster care by assisting with sustainable behavior changes in caregivers to eliminate or reduce the reoccurrence of CA/N and entry into foster care; however, continued evaluation is needed and ongoing to achieve an approval rating through the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse in the future.

Additionally, Oklahoma through partnership with a community-based provider has a Kinship Navigator Program called Family KINnections (FamKIN). This program was developed and implemented in 2012 through the 5-year Family Connection grant award under Child Welfare/TANF Collaboration in Kinship Navigation Programs (HHS-2012-ACF-ACYF-CF-0510). There were a couple of years lapse in operations due to the federal funding ending, but was re-initiated in 2017 through a private foundation funding award and is currently sustained under Title IV-B, subpart 2 kinship navigator grant award. FamKIN's purpose is to increase the stability and permanency of kinship foster care and develop effective partnerships among formal and informal community supports for kinship families. FamKIN provides home-based services aimed at assisting kinship caregivers reduce stress, meet a variety of service needs, and improve stability for foster children. During the program's implementation, outcomes were independently evaluated by the Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (CCAN) housed within the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC). Based on the practice criteria being the same for kinship navigator programs as required for the Title IV-E Prevention and Family Services and Program, continued evaluation is needed and ongoing toward achieving an approval rating through the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse; therefore, Oklahoma will not be seeking approval for Family First Title IV-E prevention funds for this program at this time.

# SafeCare®

SafeCare® is an evidence-based parent training program that was developed for and evaluated with multi-problem families involved in the child welfare system, or at high risk for involvement, due to neglect, physical abuse or both, with a primary goal of reducing subsequent maltreatment by helping parents learn new skills.8 SafeCare®'s behavioral intervention directly addresses parental behaviors related to home safety, home cleanliness, child medical care, and parent-child interactions.

SafeCare® targets families with children from birth to age 5. SafeCare® has been continuously implemented in Oklahoma since 2002 through the CHBS provision of OCS. This program utilizes Bachelor's level providers who visit with a family one to two times a week for approximately two hours. The length of the program can last up to six months, with the average length of service usually around four months.

SafeCare® is probably the most documented of the various child neglect intervention and prevention models currently in existence. A substantial body of literature exists on the model, including case studies, multiple baseline studies of behavior change, quasi-experimental recidivism studies, and randomized trials. Further, these services were successfully provided in both urban and rural settings. SafeCare® received a Supported rating by the California Evidence Based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare (CEBC) and the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse. SafeCare® Augmented, which includes additional support and consultation in Motivational Interviewing and Domestic Violence and Safety Planning met HHS criteria (HomVEE; Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness) for an evidence-based model. SafeCare® Augmented is available in Oklahoma for families not involved in the CW system through secondary prevention home-based family support programs and is distinct from the SafeCare® model offered through the CHBS provision of OCS through OKDHS for families involved in the CW system. Oklahoma is only seeking approval for Family First Title IV-E prevention funds for the version of SafeCare® rated as supported by the Family First Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse and is equivalent to the SafeCare® model offered through the CHBS provision of OCS. SafeCare® is trauma-informed and is a clearly defined and replicable program. SafeCare® has also shown to be cost effective and a good investment in families. The Washington State Institute for Public Policy compared the cost of providing SafeCare®, which includes staff training, salaries, travel, etc., to the cost of having a family involved with OKDHS and in foster care. They found that for every dollar spent on SafeCare®, the state saves about $20.80 in costs.9

The first randomized clinical trial of SafeCare® occurred in Oklahoma through the OCS program.10 In 2003, the evaluation team at CCAN OUHSC received a grant to study SafeCare® from the National Institute of Mental Health. An effectiveness trial was conducted in which half of the state was assigned to SafeCare®, and the other half provided services as usual. Within both services, program groups were randomized to receive ongoing coaching and training or receive standard training with no ongoing support. Outcomes demonstrated significantly greater reductions in recidivism with SafeCare® compared to Standard Care, especially for children under 5 years of age, the age group for which SafeCare® was originally designed. An additional analysis of the trial was conducted focusing on American Indian families. Results found similar outcomes.

recidivism results for the American Indian families as there were for the whole state-wide sample. Further, the families receiving SafeCare® indicated higher ratings of cultural competency, working alliance, service quality, and service benefits than did those receiving services as usual.¹¹

# Intercept®

Intercept®, developed by Youth Villages, is an integrated, trauma-informed intensive in-home parenting skills program. Intercept® was developed with the goal of safely preventing children from being placed in out of home care, or in the cases where that is unavoidable, reunifying families faster. The program was designed for youth from birth to age 18 who have emotional and/or behavioral problems and/or are at risk for child abuse or neglect. Intercept® is provided by Bachelor's and Master's level providers who are specially trained in the model and work under the supervision of a licensed mental health provider. The duration of services can last from four to nine months, with a typical length of service of about four to six months. Family Intervention Specialists work with both the child and the caregivers to address issues impacting family stability, meeting with families on an average of three times a week, depending on family need, and providing 24-hour on-call crisis support. Services are provided in the home or in the community (i.e., at school), depending on case needs. The Intercept® model utilizes an online database of evidence-based and evidence-informed practices. Providers utilize this GuideTree program to personalize the treatment plan for each family based on their strengths and needs. Intercept® assesses and addresses the impact of trauma throughout the program. Oklahoma began implementing the Intercept® model in 2014 in selected counties in the state.

The Intercept® model received a rating of supported on the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse and is the version Oklahoma is seeking approval for Family First Title IV-E prevention funds.¹² This rating was based on two studies conducted by the Center for State Child Welfare at Chapin Hall.¹³,¹⁴ Based on data from the model's implementation in Tennessee, Intercept® was found to reduce the chance of placement outside of the home by 53 percent, with sustained results at six and 12 months after the end of service. In cases where Intercept® was used to help with reunification, the odds of achieving permanency were approximately 24 percent higher for enrolled youth.

# Trauma-Informed Care Framework

Oklahoma seeks to create a child and family well-being network that is grounded in the science of hope. First Lady Sarah Stitt has demonstrated leadership in championing a movement to establish Oklahoma as a Hope-Centered State. Hope Theory provides an evidence-based approach and common language that can be used by social service providers, educators, and community leaders who are seeking ways to reduce the harmful impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs).

Our collective vision for Oklahoma builds on First Lady Stitt's vision for future generations of Oklahomans to believe that their futures can be better than their past and that they have a role to play in making that a reality. The desire is for all Oklahomans to have the ability to meet their basic needs, establish and pursue individual and family goals, create pathways, and possess the willpower to reach those goals throughout their lifespan. Hope is important for all Oklahomans and creates unlimited opportunities to improve well-being for a lifetime through education, economics, community safety, and health and human services.

Trauma-informed practices are necessary to help children and families overcome and recover from ACEs and a hope-centered, trauma-informed child and family well-being network will ensure the utilization of trauma-informed practices as tools to elevate hope and promote resiliency and well-being.

State agencies are looking for and learning about trauma-informed initiatives. Individuals, business leaders, philanthropic and non-profit organizations, and State government leaders are coming together to share ideas and support new approaches to solving the health and social problems that are the legacy of child and historical trauma. In 2018, the Trauma Informed Care Taskforce (TIC-TF) was created through Senate Bill (SB) 1517 to create a coordinated approach and identify best practices to prevent and mitigate trauma. The TIC-TF made strides in the discovery and coordination of trauma-informed initiatives across Oklahoma. However, it is apparent that TIC-TF has only scratched the surface of trauma-informed care work in Oklahoma.

Transitioning this work to the SAT and the CSAW as the legislative mandate comes to an end will provide this work with longevity and means to expand upon the groundwork laid by the TIC-TF. The infrastructure of CSAW will allow for the cross-system coordination and collaboration with private entities and state agencies and share this commitment to support a coordinated approach to prevent and mitigate trauma and transforming Oklahoma into a hope-centered, trauma-informed state.

OKDHS, along with agencies across the state are committed to implementing a trauma-informed care framework to better serve Oklahomans. In the fall of 2019, OKDHS began strategic planning to become the first hope-centered and trauma-informed state organization. A trauma-informed child-and family-service system is one in which all parties involved recognize and respond to the impact of traumatic stress on children, caregivers, and service providers. Programs and agencies within such a system infuse and sustain trauma awareness, knowledge, and skills into their organizational cultures, practices, and policies. They act in collaboration with all those who are involved with the family to facilitate and support the recovery and resiliency of the child and family. Children who have experienced the types of trauma that precipitate entry into the CW system.

Typically suffer impairments in many areas of development and functioning, including attachment, biology, mood regulation, dissociation, behavioral control, cognition, self-concept, and development. The full extent of the developmental impact of trauma is generally not captured and can lead to inappropriate or ineffective treatment approaches.

A trauma-informed, service-delivery framework of Oklahoma's Title IV-E Prevention Program will be administered through a hope-centered approach that is a strengths-based organizational structure grounded in the science of hope. The framework will reflect an understanding and recognition of the widespread impact of trauma, and respond to staff, children, and families through the integration of this knowledge into policies, programs, and practices to strengthen well-being for all. A hope-centered and trauma-informed care approach to service delivery includes:

- An awareness and understanding of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and their impact on children, families, communities, and those who serve them;
- A grounding in and understanding of Hope Theory and its application to buffer the effects of ACEs;
- Implementing the principles of a trauma-informed approach;
- Creating and supporting pathways to build and achieve goals, and sustain willpower; and
- Promoting hope, recovery and resilience through engagement, empowerment, and collaboration.

A hope-centered, trauma-informed CW system approach will enhance system-wide capacity, allow for application of the science of hope and a trauma-informed lens, and sustain the supports, resources, and services within the Oklahoma Title IV-E Prevention Program. The foundation of a hope-centered, trauma-informed approach is a knowledgeable workforce who can assess need and connect through referral children and families to a service array that meets their needs, and monitor and evaluate the continuing appropriateness of the services provided. Further information on child welfare workforce training and support is provided in Section 7: Child Welfare Workforce Training and Support.

Although OKDHS has more recently implemented strategies to become the first hope-centered and trauma-informed organization agency-wide, it is important to note that the CWS division placed a priority on having a trauma-informed CW system over a decade ago. A major assessment of the Oklahoma CW system's capacity and readiness to implement a trauma-informed process was conducted in 2010-2011 by the Chadwick Center for Children and Families at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego (Chadwick). Chadwick partnered with OKDHS to help create Trauma-informed CW System through the creation of the Chadwick Trauma-Informed Systems Project (CTISP).15

Specialized service delivery models to serve victims of child abuse and children exposed to domestic violence involved with the CW system. In addition, CTISP was designed to support the evolution of CW agencies into trauma-informed organizations while supporting the agencies' efforts to serve as facilitators of change in their communities. This invaluable assessment led Oklahoma's CWS to create the Trauma-Informed Systems Intervention Plan and establish an infrastructure with the capacity to create and sustain a trauma-informed system.

The Trauma-Informed Systems Intervention Plan was initiated in 2011 and targeted training and development (staff and resource parents), screening and assessment (children and adult), provider identification, workforce development, expansion of service array, and communication. The Trauma-Informed Systems Intervention Plan laid the foundation and accelerated the CW system's awareness of the importance of a trauma-informed system. CWS had a template for change, and the grant award through the Administration on Children Youth and Families, Children's Bureau, "Initiative to Improve Access to Needs-Driven, Evidence-Based/Evidence-Informed Mental and Behavioral Health Services in Child Welfare" (HHS-2012-ACF-ACYF-CO-0279), through the development and implementation of the Oklahoma Trauma Assessment and Service Center Collaborative (OK-TASCC) project was a logical and necessary next step to establish a trauma-informed system to improve outcomes for children involved in the CW system and the system itself.

The OK-TASCC project aimed to: improve the social and emotional well-being and restore the developmentally appropriate functioning of children involved in the CW system with mental and behavioral health needs; improve access to mental and behavioral health services; and enhance system transformation through supporting a trauma-informed CW system which relies on evidence-based and evidence-informed screenings, assessments, and functional outcome oriented decision-making and case planning. The project was implemented statewide through a trauma-informed systems approach which allowed for enhanced system-wide capacity and infrastructure to identify and meet the social and emotional well-being needs, reduce repeat exposure to traumas of the children served, integrations of the essential elements of a trauma-informed system, and positive outcomes at both the client-level and system-level.

The Oklahoma CW system has documented its capacity to implement the Title IV-E Prevention Program to provide prevention services to or on behalf of a child and family through a trauma-informed structure and treatment framework by infusing knowledge, awareness, and skills into organizational culture, policies and practices. This framework allows for a shift toward provisions of evidence-based, trauma-informed tools and services for children and families and improved outcomes of child safety, permanency and well-being. Oklahoma provides an assurance of a trauma-informed service-delivery and that in accordance with section 471(e)(4)(B) of the Social Security Act (the Act), each U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) approved Title IV-E prevention service identified in this Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan will be provided in accordance with a trauma-informed approach. (See Appendix E. State Assurance of Trauma-Informed Service-Delivery (ACYF-CB-PI-18-09, Attachment III)).

# Oversight and CQI

OKDHS is committed to providing continuous quality improvement (CQI) and quality assurance (QA) of the Title IV-E Prevention Program. The evaluation of the prevention services and practices permits OKDHS to determine if the targeted outcomes of child safety, permanency and well-being, parent/kin caregiver well-being, and prevention of future child maltreatment and entry into foster care are being achieved and drive system improvement. The existing CWS CQI/QA system, along with the Title IV-E Prevention Program staff, existing service contract performance and quality service delivery infrastructure, and external evaluation of the selected services will be utilized in monitoring and to refine and improve practices.

The CWS CQI/QA system is used as a program support to field staff in measuring progress and revising goals, objectives, and interventions of the Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP). This is primarily accomplished through the compilation and sharing of regional practice profiles created from Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) cases reviews. Information in these profiles that include strengths and areas needing improvement on all safety, permanency, and well-being outcome items 1-18, for each of the five regions are shared with the CWS Executive team and regional leadership teams. Additionally, data from other regularly occurring reviews including, but not limited to, initial meetings (IMs), maltreatment in care (MIC), and permanency safety consultations (PSCs), which are completed by program and QA staff, are shared regularly with regional leadership.

The qualitative and quantitative information sharing assists regional leadership teams in formulating and revising their regional charters in measuring progress and improving overall practice. Figure 10. Continuous Quality Improvement Feedback Loop, depicts this CQI feedback loop. More recently CQI staff have become regular members of the regional leadership teams, attending their monthly team meetings to provide consultation, feedback, and support based on data derived from completed reviews across various areas of work. CWS CQI/QA leadership will continue to provide feedback through regional practice profiles from the CFSR case review data compilation and analysis at ongoing and continued CQI Statewide Implementation Team (SIT) meetings. The purpose is to further measure and track progress on CFSP goals and advise on developing and revising regional charters to sustain and surpass progress realized through the Performance Improvement Plan's recent completion.

The established CWS CQI/QA administrative structure and processes will provide the continued monitoring, data collection, and analysis of family-centered practices and the broader service array available to all children and families that both prevent entry into the CW system as well as to provide ongoing support upon exit. The analysis of this data will identify gaps between the needs and the effectiveness of the services at a child and family level and be provided to Programs staff for program improvement and appropriateness of the services array. The continued focus on family-centered practice improvement and a hope-centered, trauma-informed systems approach provides the potential to serve more families through prevention and not within foster care. The aim, as stated previously, is not to bring more families into the CW system, but rather improve prevention practices and enhance and expand the services and supports available for families. For more information on the CQI/QA system for the CWS division please see Oklahoma's 2020-2024 CFSP and 2021 Annual Progress and Services Report (APSR), Section on Quality Assurance System.

Direct services are performed by a combination of both state agencies and community-based contract provider agencies. Contracts for federal, state, and OKDHS funds are awarded by the Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services and are based on a fixed-rate or competitive bidding process in accordance with state law. Bids are generally awarded based on best value for OKDHS, proven records of providing quality services in the community that assist and support parents in their role as caregivers.

in alignment with the individual family strengths and needs. Each request for proposal specifies the communities and/or population targeted for services, emphasizes the use of and collaboration with community services, whenever possible, and includes outcomes and/or deliverables specific to the community and/or population's identified needs.

Oversight is provided by OKDHS program and contract staff in the form of monthly reports received by the contractors, quarterly site visits and contractor meetings and through the annual contract renewal process. OKDHS enters into individual contracts with the federally recognized tribes in Oklahoma to provide foster care and adoption services, Successful Adulthood services, Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC), post-adoption and guardianship subsidies. Additionally, OKDHS contracts with qualifying tribes for state Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) program funds.

The tribal program staff monitors those contracts through site visits and ongoing support to tribal staff and in accordance with state and federal IV-B funding guidelines.

In addition to the oversight described for service contract performance and quality service delivery to children and families, OKDHS will continue to utilize the Oklahoma Children's Services (OCS) contract liaisons who serve as the gatekeeper for OCS referrals. In their role, they will monitor OCS contractor case records, enhance coordination and communication feedback loops between field staff and contract providers, provide oversight and guidance to the OCS contractor, and monitor and review cases to ensure the participating child and family receive the necessary voluntary prevention and intervention-related services.

The activities completed by the OCS contract liaison in reviewing the OCS referrals, which includes a case review of the information available in the CCWIS system, ensuring the OCS services are appropriate and will meet the identified needs of the child and family, participating in case consultation and monthly staffings with CW supervisors, specialists and contract staff, and monitoring and auditing of OCS contracted cases all provide CQI/QA processes and feedback loops, to ensure timely and appropriate services and engagement of CW field staff and stakeholders in informing the Title IV-E Prevention Program and services.

OKDHS will implement a third-level review process through monthly case reviews performed by the Family First Prevention Services Program Administrator. This new process will ensure the services implemented as part of the Title IV-E Prevention Program are serving the intended populations. The monthly case reviews will ensure eligibility (either through candidacy or as a pregnant or parenting foster youth), accurate approval of service referrals by the OCS contract liaisons, including to determine if the referrals made by the CW specialists are appropriate, and feedback loops between field staff and providers through monthly case staffings are being held as required.

Furthermore, the reviews will ensure the information covered addresses measurable outcomes and progress of the child and family needs related to the child's safety, permanency, or well-being or to prevent the child from entering foster care, and if services and interventions are achieving the desired behavioral changes to increase protective capacities. The results of this process and any corrective actions will be shared with leadership quarterly during regional leadership team meetings.

OKDHS is committed to the active inclusion and participation of staff at all levels of the agency, children, youth, families, and stakeholders throughout the CQI processes and activities and understand it is essential to ensuring a successful prevention program and services for children and families. Given that the Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan is designed to be aligned and integrated within a broader prevention continuum, sufficient to keep children safe and to meet the children's and families' needs towards a child and family well-being network, it relies heavily on cross-system collaboration. OKDHS will continue to coordinate and communicate with our partners through existing feedback loops. The communication structure and feedback loops have been established within the OKDHS CWS leadership team and stakeholders which are detailed in Section 2: Consultation and Coordination on a Prevention Continuum of Care.

OKDHS will be contracting with University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center – Department of Pediatrics (OUHSC), an external evaluation entity, for evaluation and program fidelity of the two services selected and requested for approval of Family First Title IV-E prevention funds. OKDHS will collaborate with OUHSC in creating an internal review process tool to examine the gatekeeping process and to determine if the referrals for the Title IV-E prevention services are appropriate, as well as to ensure eligibility and feedback loops between field staff and providers. In addition to the evaluation plan's fidelity monitoring, the services in Oklahoma's Title IV-E prevention plan require fidelity measures to which the contract providers must adhere to in order to administer the evidence-based model. These required fidelity measures and the evaluation plan is further described in Section 5: Evaluation Strategy and/or Waiver Request.

# SECTION 5: EVALUATION STRATEGY AND/OR WAIVER REQUEST

OKDHS partnered with OUHSC to conduct the evaluation and CQI efforts of the selected models, SafeCare® and Intercept®. Both models were reviewed by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse and each received an overall rating of "Supported." The methodology proposed to evaluate these programs are similar and described here together. The design of the evaluation closely follows the recommended guidance of the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse Handbook (https://preventionservices.abtsites.com/review-process). All aspects of the evaluation design, implementation and outcome analysis, and report will be through OUHSC.

# Evaluation Team

The evaluation will be led by Dr. David Bard, Professor and Director of the Biomedical and Behavioral Methodology Core (BBMC) and Dr. Debra Hecht, Associate Professor at the Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (CCAN). The BBMC is a collaboration of researchers and biostaticians from across the Department of Pediatrics, the Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, and the College of Public Health. BBMC faculty and staff offer specialized methods expertise in Bayesian methods, clinical trials, field trials and survey research, study design and management, measurement and psychometrics, analysis of complex sampling designs, generalized linear modeling, generalized latent variable modeling, longitudinal and spatial analysis, time series and dynamic modeling, quantitative genetics, population genetics, computational programming and statistics, software development, database design and management, bioinformatics, and qualitative data methods.

Dr. Bard is a health services researcher with expertise in methodology, biostatistics, psychometrics, informatics, genetics, and behavioral science. He is currently the Director of the BBMC at OUHSC and Professor and a Children's Hospital Foundation Endowed Chair in the OUHSC Department of Pediatrics. As a member of OUHSC CCAN, he is very active in research evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness of interventions aimed at prevention of future child maltreatment and general improvement of family and child health and well-being.

Dr. Hecht is a clinical child psychologist and an Associate Professor of Pediatrics. She has been the Principal Investigator on the statewide evaluation of OCS since 2000. She was an Investigator on an NIMH R01 project examining the statewide implementation of SafeCare® (Effectiveness Trial of SafeCare® for Neglect. NIMH R01MH065667; Chaffin [PI], Hecht). Dr. Hecht oversaw the model's implementation, as well as serving as a trainer, consultant, and main liaison with the provider agencies. She has worked on several programs in Oklahoma, as well as federally funded implementation efforts in California, to assist with the implementation and adaptation of SafeCare® to the home visitation programs. She has considerable experience and relationships with many provider agencies in Oklahoma who work with CW families, and experience in implementing new practices into the home visitation programs.

CCAN is a university-based, interdisciplinary center dedicated to the prevention and treatment of CA/N. CCAN has demonstrated its capacity to accommodate reasonable scientific rigor within the demands and realities of services research, along with well-established research-practice partnerships with state authorities and front-line service provider agencies. The overall focus of these collaborations was to develop, adapt, rigorously test, refine, and move to scaled-up implementation with evidence-based child welfare intervention models. The focus was both on developing or adapting the evidence-based practices (EBPs) themselves and on improving strategies for how these models can be implemented with fidelity at-scale within large public sector child welfare service systems.

OUHSC has collaborated with OKDHS for over 20 years on program evaluations, implementation, and dissemination endeavors. The most recent and relevant collaborations between OKDHS and BBMC/CCAN involved the implementation and evaluation of the state's Title IV-E Waver Demonstration Project, Intensive Safety Services (Bard and Hecht), the implementation and evaluation of the state's kinship navigation program (Hecht and Thompson), and the ongoing evaluation of Oklahoma Children's Services (OCS) which utilizes SafeCare® (Hecht). The OUHSC CCAN research team is independent of OKDHS and the researchers are bound by research protocols at the University of Oklahoma. The evaluation team will ensure that all research ethics are followed. This established partnership and collaboration will ensure diverse perspectives, so the program and evaluation needs and challenges are identified; creative solutions are implemented; outcomes measures relevant to all stakeholders are collected; and information is effectively disseminated. Overall, the evaluation's quality will be insured through this structure.

# Overview of Research Questions and Design

Each program is currently used in Oklahoma as both an alternative option to placement and as a service to strengthen family reunification. The evaluation planned will only consider the alternative to placement use, as clients of these program meet the current proposed definition for Family First Title IV-E prevention candidacy. Impact evaluation of both programs seeks to answer research questions (RQs) related to two key distal outcomes of effectiveness: Does engagement in the program lead to a significant…

1. Reduction in future maltreatment reports?
2. Reduction in foster care entry and/or re-entry?

The theory of change underlying these hypothesized differences asserts that engagement in each program will lead to higher levels of protective factors for the family (e.g., SafeCare® will increase positive parent-child interactions, higher levels of home safety and care for child health; Intercept® will lead to increased use of non-violent discipline practices, more effective parenting skills, higher levels of emotional support, greater understanding of trauma's impact on self and others) in the short-term and these increases will lead to lower incidence and severity of future maltreatment in the intermediate-term and lower overall numbers of children in the foster care system over

HHS-ACYF-CB-Title IV-E Prevention Program

the long-term. In the design proposed for both intervention models, engagement will be operationalized as an ordinal factor with three measured levels: no treatment exposure, partial treatment (partial service goal attainment), and full treatment (complete service goal attainment). Tests for group differences among the no treatment exposure group and two types of treatment exposed groups will be examined separately using matched comparison procedures described below.

To the extent possible, short-term differences in well-being will be examined as secondary outcomes. A behavioral health indicator is currently available system-wide for all children meeting the candidacy definition. This indicator will be evaluated for treatment exposure differences in the same manner as the re-report and foster care entry outcomes. Specifically, the following research question (RQ) for each program will be addressed:

1. Does engagement in the program (SafeCare® or Intercept®) lead to improved child functioning over time?

In addition, each focal treatment model assesses clients on a unique set of proximal indicators of effect. For instance, families receiving the SafeCare® model receive pre- and post-module assessments of parenting skills, depression symptoms, domestic violence, safety of the home environment, and parental substance abuse. Similarly, youth receiving the Intercept® model are assessed for school status, involvement with the justice system, employment, pregnancy, and parenting. Pre- and post-treatment changes in all of these model-specific measures will be evaluated among the partial and full goal attainment groups to evaluate the following RQs:

1. Does engagement in the program (SafeCare® or Intercept®) lead to significant improvements in proximal indicators of treatment effect?
2. Does level of engagement (partial vs. full completion) in the program predict the amount of change observed in proximal indicators of treatment effect?

The evaluation planned for both intervention models will utilize quasi-experimental methods. Matched comparison group studies will be deployed to separately evaluate the effectiveness of each model as an alternative to placement program. The matched comparison procedures are described in the next section and will rely on a propensity score matching approach. These studies are deemed "quasi" experimental due to fact that service assignment is not random as it would be in a true experiment. The attempt is to "repair a broken experiment" by closely matching profiles of confounding variables, such as characteristics that likely affect treatment assignment and the outcome, from SafeCare® and Intercept® clients with those from families who received an array of OKDHS Services As Usual (SAU). This approach creates greater balance between the treatment exposed and SAU conditions, mimicking the theoretical results of a randomized experiment. If balance on all confounding variables is achieved, intent-to-treat analyses of matched groups leads to unbiased estimates of treatment effectiveness.

# Matched Comparison Procedures

Matched comparison samples for both the SafeCare® and Intercept® evaluations will be constructed to compare outcomes with two separate groups of program clients: full-completers and partial-completers. These matched groups will be drawn from a pool of historic clients who received OKDHS SAU, which represent a variety of prevention services available to families following an assessment or investigation of a maltreatment allegation. Families will be excluded from SAU if: (1) any child is removed immediately following assessment/investigation; or (2) if OKDHS determines the allegations to be unfounded or unsubstantiated and does not recommend any preventive services prior to closing the case. Eligible SAU matches will be included in a propensity score model that follows the covariate balancing methodology of Imai and Ratkovic.16 Propensity score variables will include the following: prior number of reports, prior number of placements, safety threats from the initiating referral (the first family referral in the catchment period), protective capacities identified at the initial referral, broad allegation type (physical abuse, neglect, or sexual abuse), household size, number of children, average caregiver age, average child age, primary race-ethnicity, and county level indicators (RUCA code, median HH income, annual referral count average, annual placement count average).

Following the construction of propensity scores, sets of treatment and SAU clients will be grouped into homogenous strata using the "full match" procedures outlined in Austin and Stuart.17 Balance diagnostics on standardized differences18 on all covariates will be employed to evaluate the quality of the matching procedures. Variables associated with > 10 percent imbalance will be included in the statistical models to further control for possible bias. Matching restrictions using calipers that eliminate matched strata where propensity differences exceed a caliper/threshold will also be explored to further minimize imbalance and evaluate the robustness of estimated treatment effects, with and without pruning away matches.

# Measures

Three sets of measures will be evaluated under the planned design. Common measures, described next, are outcomes broadly available in the state's KIDS system (Oklahoma's Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System). These represent variables that should be measured on nearly all families receiving treatment or SAU services. In contrast, model-specific outcomes are also available for study, but these data only exist for clients of one type of treatment model (SafeCare® or Intercept®).

These model-specific outcomes were measured at two time-points, usually intake and post-treatment, and will be analyzed using single-group pre-post methodologies.

# Common Measures

# Time to re-report

A time to re-report variable (for RQ #1) will be constructed using Child Protective Services (CPS) outcomes within the state's KIDS system. Time to event outcomes will be calculated for each recorded child associated with a referral. However, the analysis unit will be the family, and only event time, the minimum, will be retained for each unique referral. In the event that children are removed without the occurrence of a subsequent report, the earliest removal date on record will be considered the family's re-report date.

# Time to placement

Construction of a time-to-placement variable (for RQ #2) will follow the same approach outlined above for time-to-re-report outcomes. In this instance, the date of earliest removal following the initial referral will be used as the marker of a placement event. These durations could reflect removals associated with the initial referral, specifically when safety threats do not lower following treatment/SAU exposure or with a subsequent referral namely new allegations surfacing during or after treatment/SAU exposure.

# Child Behavioral Health Screeners (CBHS)

The Child Behavioral Health Screeners are a set of 11 partially overlapping instruments that vary in the domain measured and the appropriate age range for administration. Plainly, the indicators of behavioral health for a 5-month-old are often quite distinct from those of a 5-year-old, and these distinctions explain the diversity of CBHS instruments. Four of the instruments will be evaluated under this design, and collectively these are administered to the vast majority of children receiving services from OKDHS. For all children between 4 and 17 years of age, a single measure is used - the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC).19 For younger children, other measures utilized are: (1) the Baby Pediatric Symptom Checklist (BPSC), ages 0 to 17 months; (2) the Preschool Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PPSC), ages 18 to 48 months; and a measure of child development, Milestones, ages 0 to 48 months. Administering each of these measures is dependent on different versions based upon the child's age. While administration compliance is not perfect, OKDHS guidance calls for monthly administration of all age-appropriate CBHS measures. These indicators will be used as secondary outcomes to evaluate group differences in child well-being (RQ #3). CBHS data first appeared in the KIDS system in March 2017, so analyses of these outcomes will be restricted to cohorts with initial referrals ensuing on or after this month.

# SafeCare® Specific Measures

Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CESD) Short form. A 10-item version²⁰ of the CESD is completed by the primary caregiver in the family at intake and at the end of SafeCare® services. A total summed score will be used in analyses to assess pre- to post-treatment response.

Child Well-Being Scale (CWBS).²¹ This instrument is completed by the SafeCare® provider at intake and at the end of SafeCare® services. The measure includes items that cover four domains of interest for this evaluation: substance use, domestic violence, parenting capacity, and safety of the home/environment. Summed scale scores will be calculated and analyzed among the SafeCare® clients only, as a targeted indicator of treatment response.

# Intercept® Specific Measures

Intercept® providers collect the following outcomes at admission, discharge, and 12-months post-discharge.

Behavioral and Functional Indicators: The focal child of therapy is assessed on school status and negative involvement with the justice system; older youth are also assessed on employment, pregnancy, and parenting.

# Analysis Plan

# Preliminary analyses.

All data will be examined for outliers and nonsensible entries and abnormal findings will be remedied with direct input from OKDHS data experts. Key bivariate relationships will be checked for non-linearity to identify unexpected relationships that may need to be modeled in the propensity score procedures or in the analytic models. Variable transformations will be used when deemed appropriate in order to meet analytic inferential assumptions, for example, multivariate Normal outcomes. In general, more saturated models will be explored first with terms that fail to contribute dropped to arrive at a final reduced model.

# Time-to-Event Analyses (RQs #1 & #2).

Primary outcome analyses will involve estimation of the time-to-event curves for each modeled group. Weighted Cox regression modeling will be used to test the statistical significance in hazard ratios of two groups. Three separate Cox models, per treatment model (SafeCare® and Intercept®) and outcome (re-report and placement), will be run to compare the SAU matched groups to.

Partial treatment completers, full completers, and all treatment exposed clients. Weighting for the full matched propensity strata and robust variance estimation approaches of Austin and Stuart²² will be utilized for these analyses.

Results from the time-to-placement models will be further evaluated to address realized and potential impact on the State's foster care population count. Population attributable fractions (PAFs)²³ for SafeCare® and Intercept® exposure will be estimated for this purpose. A PAF represents the predicted proportional reduction in cases, such as children placed in out-of-home care, when enhanced protective measures (treatment exposure) are enacted. PAF results with confidence bands will be produced to estimate realized treatment exposure reductions and idealized exposure reductions when all SAU members receive treatment.

# Child Behavioral Health Analyses (RQ #3)

CBHS measures are collected monthly on all children receiving OKDHS services. A multilevel regression model will be employed to evaluate change on each of the four separate screener scores utilized for children between 0 and 17 years of age. Analyses will focus on the youngest child within each family. The multilevel models will be structured as growth models using measures for up to one year following the initiating referral. Higher order polynomial terms will be included in the models, as warranted by statistical tests, to capture any nonlinearity in response trajectories. Random effect terms will be used to account for intra-person variability in response over time. Full information maximum likelihood procedures will be used for estimation, in part, to manage incomplete vectors of output due to absent administrations or attrition. Group differences in growth trajectories will be assessed with effect contrasts comparing expected values at monthly intervals. Weighting and robust variance estimation techniques will be employed to account for the propensity score estimation procedures.

# Model-specific Within-group Analyses (RQs #4 & #5)

Generalized linear models will be used to evaluate changes in model-specific outcomes from intake to post-treatment assessments (RQ #4). Additional analyses will be performed for the Intercept® clients who also have follow-up assessment data. No propensity matching procedures will be necessary for these tests, as only the model exposed clients will be measured on these outcomes and included in these analyses. Differences in these change score outcomes will also be compared using a Partial and Complete treatment group indicator (RQ #5).

# Sample Size

Annual anticipated sample sizes for each treatment model and for the SAU population were estimated using the State's KIDS system. These administrative data suggest an

annual accrual of 1,300+ SafeCare® families and 50+ Intercept® families. Ratios of partial to full completion were comparable for both treatment models at roughly 1.5. The number of eligible SAU matches was determined to be larger than these annual client tallies by a factor 3 and >100 for SafeCare® and Intercept®, respectively. These SAU comparison pools should be more than adequate in size for creating good balance with the proposed matching procedures.

# Power Analysis

To evaluate the statistical power of the design, OKDHS conservatively limited treatment samples to 95 percent of anticipated annual capacity and matches to be 1 to 1. Estimates were calculated for matched comparisons of the partial goal attainers, full attainers, and combined treatment samples. Given the primacy of time-to-event data, OKDHS concentrated on approximating minimal detectable differences (MDEs) for the event history analyses. One year survival (no re-report/placement event) proportion differences were estimated using the proc power package of SAS® 9.4 under the assumption of uniform accrual of all participants within the first year and assuming one additional year of follow-up per client. The minimal detectable survival improvements were estimated for three possible SAU (reference) survival proportions with power and Type I error set at 0.80 and 0.05, respectively. The approximated MDEs are depicted in Table 3: One Year Survival Proportion, for each treatment subgroup, partial vs full, separately and then as a combined sample. Detectable effect sizes for SafeCare® are reasonably small for all SAU base rates. Even with 90 percent survival among the SAU participants, a small improvement of four percent is statistically significant for the smallest SafeCare® subgroup, the full attainers.

The same is not true for the Intercept® model, where relying on only a single year of data produces excessive MDEs. Rerunning these analyses for three years of data (see 2ⁿᵈ set of Intercept® estimates in final row panel of Table 3), however, results in much more promising MDEs. Under this scenario, differences as small as 0.07, when SAU base rate is 0.90, and as large as 0.14, with a base rate of 0.50, are detectable for the combined Intercept® group. Oklahoma currently has more than three years of past data available to include with all future Intercept® assigned cases. Table 3 summarizes the one year survival proportion described above. Thus, OKDHS intends to combine the historic and future case counts in our analyses in order to boost statistical power for this model's evaluation. Any noticeable differences in effectiveness by year will be quantified in these analyses.

# Challenges and Limitations

The design proposed is quasi-experimental and suffers most of the usual causal effect limitations of nonrandomized studies. The methodology proposed does attempt to strengthen claims of causal effect by employing matching techniques that balance non-equivalent treatment and comparison groups on key covariates. The methods rely on two key assumptions. First, the matching procedure output is only as good as the input it receives. The current design is limited to using administrative data, and this leaves open the strong possibility that other key (unmeasured) confounding variables are "lurking," may not be balanced across our matched groups, and thus, could bias the treatment effect estimates. To address this challenge, OKDHS is utilizing as much data as possible in the propensity scoring model, including external data from other systems providing information on county level indicators of interest. Second, the quality of matching also depends on the proper specification of the propensity scoring procedure. OKDHS elected to use a highly robust form of propensity scoring which optimally balances all observed covariates without the necessity of iterative refitting techniques. Nonetheless, all models are only partial reflections of reality, and so to further evaluate the selected methods' sensitivity, OKDHS intends to compare results using other commonly employed PS approaches. A third concern involves the disproportionate use of temporary child placements with a “safety monitor” that do not qualify as foster care entry. There is some worry that this approach may occur more frequently among the studied services than it does in SAU. To address this concern, we plan to explore subgroup analyses of treatment effect that exclude these cases from the statistical models. Finally, OKDHS must note the limitations of missing data that often plague administrative data systems. To address this challenge, the intent is to rely on full information maximum likelihood approaches to estimation, allowing for the inclusion of partial outcome vectors in the analytic models. OKDHS also plans to explore multiple.

Imputation approaches to modeling missing covariates, since these missing data may bias the propensity score estimation and balancing procedures.

# Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) Plan

Continuous quality improvement (CQI) efforts will be undertaken by coordination of the evaluators, OKDHS, and the provider agencies. The same basic framework will be applied to the CQI plans for both the SafeCare® and Intercept® programs. Both programs have model specific fidelity procedures for the service providers that are being completed by the provider agencies and overseen by the model developers and these processes have been in place within these service agencies and programs for many years. The model fidelity processes will be reviewed and monitored by the evaluation team. Additional CQI efforts around gatekeeping will be completed by OKDHS to ensure that the model is appropriately applied to the intended population. Both intervention programs also are collecting client satisfaction measures, and this data will also be reviewed and integrated into the CQI process. Quarterly meetings between each program, the evaluators, and OKDHS will occur to review the fidelity and compliance data and to share successes and address any barriers to the ongoing implementation to maximize the impact of the evidence-based practices provided to families.

# SafeCare®

# Model Fidelity and Internal CQI for Providers

The National SafeCare® Training and Research Center (NSTRC) has specific requirements for certification and maintenance (ongoing fidelity) of SafeCare® providers, coaches, and trainers, as well as for the accreditation of the agencies providing the model. SafeCare® has been utilized in Oklahoma since 2002, and a robust system is in place for the training and maintenance of the certification of SafeCare® providers. Steve Ross, MA, is a part of the OUHSC CCAN team and he is the Head Trainer and Training Coordinator of SafeCare® for the state. As such, he is responsible for monitoring and assisting with the trainer, coach, and provider certification and maintenance processes in accordance with the expectations of NSTRC.

SafeCare® requires that each provider be trained by a certified trainer, and then followed by a certified coach who monitors fidelity and guides them back to the protocol when there is drift. Oklahoma currently has eight certified trainers housed within the OCS contracted service agencies, and 11 certified coaches, also housed within the contracted agencies. Coaches work directly with the providers, attending client visits and providing real time observation, modeling, and feedback. These observations are necessary for a provider to achieve and maintain SafeCare® certification. To achieve certification, a provider must demonstrate 85 percent or greater fidelity for three sessions from each of the three SafeCare® modules, which is nine total sessions. Once certified, monthly fidelity checks and coaching sessions document ongoing quality of services. When fidelity is low, additional coaching sessions will be added until strong fidelity is achieved on two consecutive sessions.



---

HHS-ACYF-CB-Title IV-E Prevention Program
# Oklahoma Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan FFY2022-2026

SafeCare® coaches require specific training and they must pass six units of Coach Support, with at least two of those centered on achieving reliability in their assessment of provider fidelity. SafeCare® trainers also have specific fidelity markers they must meet in the administration of SafeCare® training. Mr. Ross is responsible for the training, certification, and maintenance of the coaches and trainers in Oklahoma.

All of the provider fidelity forms are entered into NSTRC's SafeCare® Portal, and real time reports are available to monitor compliance and fidelity. Mr. Ross and Dr. Hecht meet monthly with the SafeCare® coaches and trainers to discuss issues related to implementation and fidelity. At least quarterly, a review will be conducted of each coach's provider team with particular focus on team members who need additional support to maintain model fidelity. OKDHS, OUHSC, and the provider agencies have a standing quarterly meeting where this and other implementation issues are discussed.

# Fidelity to Serving Intended Population

For the purposes of Title IV-E prevention eligibility, appropriate SafeCare® referrals would include children eligible either through candidacy as defined and served through a Family-Centered Services (FCS) case or as a pregnant or parenting foster youth and served through a Permanency Planning (PP) case. This intervention's main focus is parenting skills, behavior, and knowledge. To be eligible for Title IV-E prevention dollars, at least one of the children must be under the age of 5, which is the target age group for SafeCare®. Families are referred to SafeCare® by a child welfare (CW) specialist and the cases are gatekept by the Oklahoma Children's Services (OCS) contract liaison before forwarding to the provider agency. The internal review process to examine the gatekeeping process and to determine if the referrals made by the CW specialists are appropriate was described previously in Section 4: Title IV-E Prevention Services and Oversight. OKDHS will collaborate with OUHSC in creating an internal review process tool.

# Intended Outcomes

The primary outcome of preventing children from entering state custody will be available from the evaluation of SafeCare® for the Family First Title IV-E prevention population detailed elsewhere in this plan.

# Client Satisfaction

All families will receive a Client Satisfaction Questionnaire as they exit the program with the option for the family to complete the survey securely online, or they will be able to complete a paper version of the survey and return it to OUHSC in a postage paid return envelope to ensure confidentiality. The questionnaire will measure parents' perceptions of the services received, including questions about their satisfaction with the program, ease of access to the services, and their self-evaluation of progress on addressing identified needs. Aggregate results of this measure will be shared with OKDHS and the provider agencies to help assess if the program is addressing the clients' needs and if any implementation issues are identified that would need to be addressed.

robust training and model review process. The frontline providers, or Family Intervention Specialists, receive thorough training on the model through a comprehensive orientation process including on-the-job training and an intensive four day training on clinical foundations. Specialists also receive other trainings on Evidence Based Practices (EBP), as needed, based on their caseload make up. Each Specialist then receives weekly consultation with a Licensed Program Expert (LPE) to receive feedback on the development and implementation of their service plans with children and families through Youth Villages' clinical conceptualization process, GuideTree. Added oversight and supervision is completed for high-needs cases and specialized safety interventions are developed, implemented, and monitored across clinical and operational processes. As a part of GuideTree, the LPEs attend a yearlong training where they are trained on the model and on supervision techniques, and receive additional coaching for 12 months. The Specialists also receive added supervision from a separate clinical supervisor. Clinical supervisors work on staff development plans with their Specialists and meet weekly for staff development. The LPEs are also supervised by the Clinical Services Program Manager to ensure that all procedures are followed. Clinical Services Program Managers work with state leadership to ensure all policies, best practices, and fidelity procedures are high quality. Internal checklists, performance and development plans, and review forms serve to document these fidelity processes.

In addition to this staff monitoring process, Youth Villages performs program model reviews on a regular basis utilizing a random selection of cases. This process involves the review of measures and interview data from youth, parents, staff, supervisors, and the LPE. An extensive document review is conducted of the clinical record, consultation notes, staff development plans, and other assessments. This review generates scores that indicate areas of strength and areas that need additional attention to help ensure that families and youth meet the expected outcomes. Youth Villages also uses a Balanced Scorecard approach as a monthly process of examining leading and lagging indicators in both clinical and operational areas. Measures include average monthly census, staff caseload, staff tenure, percent of successful discharges, and number of critical incidents. Quarterly meetings between Youth Villages, OUHSC, and OKDHS will occur where this and other implementation issues can be discussed.

# Fidelity to Serving Intended Population

For the purposes of Title IV-E prevention eligibility, appropriate Intercept® referrals would include children eligible either through candidacy as defined and served through a Family-Centered Services (FCS) case or as a pregnant or parenting foster youth and served through a Permanency Planning (PP) case. The intervention's main focus is the child's behavioral challenges and/or the child's mental health issues, and can serve families with children 0 -18 years of age. Families are referred to Intercept® by a CW specialist and the cases are gate kept by the OCS contract liaison before being forwarded to the provider agency. The internal review process to examine the gatekeeping process and to determine if the referrals made by the CW specialists are appropriate was described previously in Prevention Services and Oversight. OKDHS will collaborate with OUHSC in creating an internal review process tool.

# Intended Outcomes

The primary outcome of preventing children from entering state custody will be available from the evaluation of Intercept® for the Family First Title IV-E prevention population detailed elsewhere in this plan.

# Client Satisfaction

All families will receive a Client Satisfaction Questionnaire as they exit the program. There will be the option for the family to complete the survey securely online, or they will be able to complete a paper version of the survey and return it to OUHSC in a postage paid return envelope to ensure confidentiality. The questionnaire will measure parents' perceptions of the services received, including questions about their satisfaction with the program, ease of access to the services, and their self-evaluation of progress on addressing identified needs. Aggregate results of this measure will be shared with OKDHS and the provider agencies to help assess if the program is meeting the clients' needs and if any implementation issues are identified that need to be addressed.

# SECTION 6: MONITORING CHILD SAFETY

The safety of children is paramount within Oklahoma's CW system. Safety is a priority from the time a report of child maltreatment is received, throughout the safety evaluation process, and until a child is determined to be safe in his or her own home. The Practice Standards and Practice Model, described in previous sections, were developed and implemented with an emphasis on child safety and family preservation. The development and implementation of the Safety through Supervision framework as part of Oklahoma's CFSR Program Improvement Plan further emphasized the vital importance of safety.

OKDHS CWS staff are responsible for ensuring a child's safety, permanency and well-being through the provision of targeted case management services. Per OKDHS CWS policy, case management services assist children access medical, social, educational, and other required services to meet their needs. Case management services include:

- assessing the child's needs;
- coordinating the delivery of appropriate services as defined in the assessment;
- assisting the child and family in accessing appropriate services;
- monitoring the child and family's progress by making referrals, tracking appointments, following up on services rendered, and reassessing the child's and family's needs;
- advocating on behalf of the child and family;
- consulting with service providers or collateral contacts to determine the status or progress of the child's and family's plan;
- arranging for crisis assistance, such as coordinating needed emergency services; and
- continually assessing for safety.

As described in previous sections, OKDHS utilizes the AOCS beginning at the Hotline with the information gathered during the initial call, through the CPS safety evaluation and investigation process to determine child safety and if intervention is necessary, and through FCS and PP programs to continue to assess child safety and explore how family behaviors and functioning changes overtime. CW specialists rely on the safety evaluation process and AOCS tool to continually identify and articulate how safety threats either remain or how they are changing and resolving as the family and services progress to correct the identified unsafe behaviors. The safety evaluation processes build upon the initial AOCS, completed during the CPS safety evaluation and investigation, incorporate AOCS into the prevention and permanency planning processes with the family to assess their strengths, identify their needs and supports to ensure the child's continued safety and pathways to enhance family functioning, and link through referral access to prevention and intervention-related culturally-relevant, community-based services.

CW specialists are always assessing for child safety through each and every contact with the child and family through the six key questions in the AOCS tool; from the initial CPS safety evaluation and investigation through FCS or PP, until the case is closed.

HHS-ACYF-CB-Title IV-E Prevention Program
# Oklahoma Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan FFY2022-2026

AOCS tool is utilized to document this assessment process throughout the life of a case. CW specialists are continually gathering information with the child, their parents, collaterals, and professionals, and any supporting evidence to make the most accurate safety decision and to determine the most appropriate level of intervention and case planning goals. The safety evaluation process and utilization of the AOCS tool allows for a structure in which CW specialists evaluate child safety and measure protective capacities to determine if or how those capacities are being enhanced to control for or manage the safety threats, and a way in which to document those efforts.

Pivotal times occur throughout the life of a case. The safety evaluation is formalized by documenting the information gathered in the AOCS tool, and obtaining a supervisor's approval. The CW specialist uses the AOCS before moving a child from an out-of-home safety plan or any time there is a significant change in the case's status or family dynamic to determine how the safety threats changed or were minimized and before case closure to assess if the safety threats were corrected. The first time the On-going AOCS is documented in a FCS case is in the first 30-calendar days after the FSA is signed, or for a PP case in the first 60-calendar days of removal or petition, to be used in developing the ISP. The AOCS tool and the six key questions within it help tell the complete family story, supporting the current state of safety threats, protective capacity and behavior, the underlying causes, addressing each safety threshold element for every threat, and promoting engagement with the family towards successfully achieving family goals.

CW specialists monitor child safety, support child and family goals, and promote child and family well-being through quality contacts and family meetings. Quality contacts are purposeful interactions between the CW specialist and a child, parents, and safety plan monitors or resource parents that reflect engagement and contribute to assessment and case planning processes. The frequency of contacts is determined and influenced by case type, child's placement setting, and family dynamics, but per Oklahoma Children's Code, 10A O.S. §§ 1-4-707, 1-7-103, and 1-7-113, and Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC) 340: 75-4-12.1 and 340:75-6-48 there are specific minimum requirements. Additionally, frequent parent engagement helps with safety threat identification and protective capacities. It also ensures that families have the needed supports to make changes and the tools to keep their children safe, which affects child safety, permanency, and well-being.

Quality contacts are important in several ways including, but not limited to, helping prevent maltreatment and maltreatment in care, building rapport and having engagement with parents, making sure that the family goals are being reached safely and timely, identifying any patterns or needs of the child or family, and identifying the protective capacities of the person responsible for the child. Additional monitoring strategies are contacts with collaterals including, but not limited to, school personnel, counselors/therapists, in-home service providers, medical providers, childcare providers, parents/caregivers, other critical case members.

OKDHS utilizes the safety evaluation process and quality contacts to ensure the child's safety, permanency and well-being and through these processes are continually.

# Oklahoma Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan FFY2022-2026

Assessing service needs and level of intervention to strengthen protective capacities of the parents or kin caregivers with the goals of preventing future child maltreatment and entry, or re-entry, into foster care. OKDHS FCS provisions are time-limited to six months and most families are successful within the standard six-month period, although some families are recognized as needing more time to enhance and strengthen protective capacities to correct the behaviors and conditions that led to CW involvement. OKDHS also understands that efforts to maintain the child in his or her own home will not be successful with some families because the behaviors and condition continue to pose a safety threat to the child due to the parent's or kin caregiver's response and participation in correcting those behaviors and conditions.

OKDHS will continually assess the child's prevention plan throughout the life of the CW case through the processes described above, and any time the child's health, safety and welfare cannot be ensured through preventive and pre-placement services, OKDHS will seek court intervention by recommending a deprive petition, per Section 1-1-105 of Title 10A of the Oklahoma Statutes (10A O.S. § 1-1-105) and OAC 340:75. When Title IV-E prevention services, as specified in the child's prevention plan, are provided to or on behalf of a child who is a candidate for foster care, per OAC 340:75-1-9 ITS, the CW specialist will hold a FM in the final month of the standard six-month service period to determine if the family requires continued Title IV-E prevention services that meet the child's, parent's, or kin caregiver's needs directly related to the child's safety, permanency, or well-being or to prevent the child from entering foster care.

A review of relevant case documentation is completed including, but not limited to, the AOCS tool, prevention plan, and ISP to determine: if safety threats are controlled and managed; if the recommended Title IV-E prevention services and interventions are achieving the desired behavioral changes to increase protective capacities; and continued eligibility of Title IV-E prevention services to ensure the child may remain safely at home, live temporarily with a kin caregiver until reunification can be safely achieved, or live permanently with a kin caregiver. If continued eligibility of Title IV-E prevention services is determined, the CW specialist will complete a request for extension of OCS, per OAC 340:75-1-152.5, and continues to monitor the child's safety and service provision, per OAC 340:75-4-12.1. If Title IV-E prevention services are needed beyond the 12-month period, the CW specialist and CW supervisor, after thorough evaluation, will consult the district director for approval to proceed to consult with the FCS Program Supervisor and Family First Prevention Services Administrator for continued approval.

# Pregnant or Parenting Foster Youth

The PP specialist ensures the youth's safety, and any child born to the youth, and monitors case plan progress through quality contacts with the youth, parent or kin caregiver, and service providers, per OAC 340:75-6-48, and as described above through the safety evaluation process. When Title IV-E prevention services as specified in the youth's prevention plan are provided to, or on behalf of, a pregnant or parenting foster youth, per OAC 340:75-1-9 ITS, the CW specialist will hold an FM in the final month of the standard six-month service period to determine if the family requires continued Title IV-E prevention services to ensure a pregnant foster youth or a foster youth parenting a child is prepared to be a parent and the foster care prevention strategy, per OAC 340:75-6-92, 340:75-11-320, and 340:75-11-321, for any child born to.

the youth meets the child's safety, permanency, or well-being or to prevent the child from entering foster care. A review of relevant case documentation is completed including, but not limited to, the AOCS, prevention plan, and ISP for determining: the youth's safety, and any child born to the youth, the recommended Title IV-E prevention services and interventions are achieving the desired outcomes, and continued eligibility of Title IV-E prevention services to ensure the youth, and any child born to the youth, may remain safely at home, live temporarily with a kin caregiver until reunification can be safely achieved, or live permanently with a kin caregiver. If continued eligibility of Title IV-E prevention services is determined, the CW specialist will complete a request for extension of OCS, per OAC 340:75-1-152.5 and continues to monitor the youth's safety, and any child born to the youth, and service provision, per OAC 340:75-6, 340:75-11-320, 340:75-11-321, and 340:75-14. If Title IV-E prevention services are needed beyond the 12-month period the CW specialist and CW supervisor, after thorough evaluation, will consult the district director for approval to proceed to consult with the FCS Program Supervisor and Family First Prevention Services Administrator for continued approval.

CW supervisors have a key role in ensuring a child's safety, permanency and well-being. A CW supervisor provides consultation and oversees the case decisions made by the CW specialists through intentional case staffing and review of case documentation. The Safety through Supervision framework was developed and implemented to improve the accessibility, consistency, and quality of CW supervision toward ensuring safety and enhance permanency and well-being outcomes for the children and families served. CW specialists and supervisors are responsible for making sound safety decisions. The framework's intent is to support CW supervisors in supporting their staff, in continually improving the quality of CWS practice through the integration of family-centered practice into all aspects of assessment, case planning, and service delivery, thus leading to improved outcomes for the children and families CWS serves.

All children deserve to grow up healthy and safe and it is the responsibility of OKDHS CWS to intervene to mitigate and ensure safety when their parents or legal guardians are unable or unwilling to do so. OKDHS CWS goals are:

- equip and empower families to provide a safe home for their children;
- when children enter foster care, understand and meet their specific needs, which includes their need for safety, connections with family, community, and culture, and addressing health, behavioral health, developmental and educational needs;
- aggressively pursue the belief that every child and youth deserves a family and the support they need to group and develop into healthy adults.

CWS aims to help families achieve true and lasting safety for their children by strengthening their protective capacities, including support by family, friends, and community, and access to supportive and preventative services. In supporting supervisors through the Safety through Supervision framework, CW supervisors continue to support CW specialists in their safety practices and decision-making on a single case, and broadens their ability to help them focus on the practice and professional development of a CW specialist. CWS expects the implementation and ongoing efforts.

# SECTION 7: CHILD WELFARE WORKFORCE TRAINING AND SUPPORT

The foundation of strong family-centered practices and a hope-centered, trauma-informed systems approach is a knowledgeable workforce, who can assess need, connect through referral children and families to a trauma-informed, evidence-based services array that meets their needs, and monitor and evaluate the continuing appropriateness of the services provided. A strong, competent workforce is critical in achieving the mission and goals of OKDHS CWS, building upon the successes thus far in our system improvements to align with the vision of Family First, to improve the safety, permanency, and well-being of children and families involved with the CW system.

OKDHS CWS has a targeted Training Plan for all CW staff with already established training, support and resources to ensure a competent, skilled, and professional trauma-informed CW workforce that can identify and meet the needs of children and families, determine the appropriateness of the services array, and engage in broader CW decision-making and case planning.

The context in which Family First is framed will contribute to the success and positive outcomes at both the child, family, and system levels. OKDHS will ensure alignment of Family First vision and values, which already connects with the OKDHS vision, mission, and values, as training and support on the Title IV-E Prevention Program is implemented.

Strong commitment and support from CWS leadership will help to create and maintain a hope-centered, trauma-informed culture at the CW specialist and supervisory levels and ensure successful implementation of the Title IV-E Prevention Program. The training infrastructure already exists and will not require creating a new training approach and method to incorporate added policy, practice and procedures for the Title IV-E Prevention Program. CWS leadership support and the existing training infrastructure will ensure the CW workforce receives the support to understand and treat safety needs, decrease trauma, and strengthen parental protective capacities with the aim to reduce child maltreatment and the need for foster care.

The Practice Model and FCS program assist CW specialists in ensuring a child's safety while helping to strengthen families and prevent child maltreatment and family separation and trauma to children and their parents. The provided training, tools, and resources support CW specialists in focusing on the entire family rather than individuals, and provide comprehensive services that engage the family and target the family's therapeutic, supportive, and concrete needs.

The additional training, tools and resources all CW staff receive through the statewide implementation of the Safety through Supervision framework has improved knowledge and skills in safety practices through safety and needs assessments enhancements that guide decision-making, case planning and service provision, and builds upon the competencies received through the Supervisors Academy. The Safety through Supervision framework outlines the theory behind the supervisory framework and provides the clear purpose, roles, and expectations of CW supervisors. It outlines three key strategies: intentional case staffing, CW specialist monthly conference, and field observation.

Framework, practice guidance for safety and needs assessments was updated for all programs. Policy Instructions to Staff included enhanced guidance related to assessing safety initially during the CPS safety evaluation and investigative process, as well as throughout the FCS and PP case until case closure. Tools and resources were provided to all CW staff to support them in conducting high quality safety evaluation with children and families and included a Safety Guidebook.23 The guidebook's compilation of resources provides definitions, examples, and guidance on the appropriate way to assess and document comprehensive safety decisions and when assessing protective capacities. CW supervisors can utilize the resources to help hold specialists accountable for best practice, as well as for support, coaching and mentoring.

The CW workforce completes a nine-week CORE training that covers foundational level knowledge, skill competencies, and CWS policy with on-the-job training periods, and a final week that concludes with an assessment of the CW specialist's ability to demonstrate practice behaviors critical to outcome achievement through the CW specialist Provisional Certification testing. Following a score of "meets standards" or "needs improvement," the CW specialist is eligible to receive a graduated caseload of 50 percent following completion of two program specific training modules, which will vary depending on the assigned track, CPS, PP, FCS, FC/A. Upon a 50 percent caseload assignment, the CW specialist begins his or her fieldwork and continues with Level 1 training. Level 1 training differs from CORE training in that the course materials build upon essential skills to enhance job performance. After a period of 90-calendar days following assignment of the 50 percent caseload, the CW supervisor observes and coaches the CW specialist's performance and makes an evaluation that determines if the CW specialist is ready to be assigned a 75 percent caseload. The same time and procedures are followed to advance from a 75 percent caseload to a 100 percent caseload. The CW specialist continues to complete Level 1 trainings and should be completed within 18 months with CWS, and then proceeds to complete Level 2 trainings. The Level 2 trainings serve as a brief refresher to build upon past information, provide updates to information that changed, and improve capacity by offering new information to enhance skills that were learned, practiced, and reinforced. Beginning the second year with CWS, a CW specialist may begin specialized training which allows to individualize one's career path and professional development plan by self-selecting trainings that add to the specialist's ability to provide quality services to children and families.

The Training Unit ensures that instruction is measured and aligns with CWS performance measures through an evaluation, and that a feedback loop is established for higher-level assessments. The Training Unit, based on feedback from state office personnel or supervisors, creates or alters training to meet a CW specialist's needs. The Oklahoma CWS training is intended to prepare a CW specialist, enhance the ability to provide quality services, and provide the support to implement those services. For the full details on the CW workforce training, please see the state's 2020-2024 State Training Plan in Oklahoma's 2020-2024 Child and Family Services Plan.

Trauma-informed principles are woven into the existing CW training to prepare CW staff in understanding, recognizing, and responding to the effects of all types of trauma. The curriculum describes the impact of trauma on child development, including brain and emotional development, the impact on attachment, and how those impacts can affect relationships. Additionally, trauma-focused foundational learning, in the areas of Motivational Interviewing and crisis de-escalation was included to build on through future level courses. OKDHS CWS will continue the trauma-informed training that already exists in the required CW training for CW specialist and supervisors, and infuse it with the Hope Theory and its application to:

- buffer the effects of ACEs;
- help create and support pathways and sustain willpower for families to preserve and strengthen protective capacities and assist the family in safely caring for the child(ren) in their own home and achieve their goals; and
- promote hope, recovery and resilience through engagement, empowerment, and collaboration.

Evidence-based services are identified and/or developed at a community level to promote child safety, permanency, well-being, and enhance the service array. CWS, through community collaboration with OSDH and ODMHSAS, and OCS ensure access to trauma-informed, evidence-based services for children and families to help mitigate child maltreatment and family separation. CW specialists and supervisors have access to mental health consultants (MHCs) who act as a liaison between CWS and community service providers to ensure access to preventive and ongoing services to children and families. MHCs provide support to CW through training, education and consultation, as well as actively participate in meetings, such as CSMs, FMs, or provider treatment team meetings, as requested by CW staff to ensure linkage and referrals to mental health and substance abuse treatment services. Additionally, CW specialists and supervisors have access to OCS contract liaisons to ensure coordination and collaboration with OCS providers for access to prevention and intervention-related services to ensure a child's health, safety and welfare. OCS contract liaisons also provide training to CW staff on OCS referral criteria and procedures, and role expectations.

The oversight and CQI described in Section 4: Title IV-E Prevention Services and Oversight and through the CFSR case review debriefings with leadership and CW supervisors and specialist, along with regional practice profiles and other qualitative review summaries will continue to provide support to the CW workforce. This information will be provided to the CWS Executive Team and regional leadership to support the CW workforce in improving practice that impact child and family outcomes. Additionally, this information will be utilized to support the CW workforce in implementation of the Family First Title IV-E Prevention Program, ensuring the training, support, and resources are provided to ensure systemic capacity to support policy and practice uptake and integration.

The established Family First planning and implementation structure will ensure the Title IV-E Prevention Program, including the training and support needs of the CW workforce, is grounded by four key principles:

74



---

HHS-ACYF-CB-Title IV-E Prevention Program
# Oklahoma Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan FFY2022-2026

• data – implementation will be done in a data-driven manner, ensuring services develop and providers are informed by outcomes;

• communication – leadership and Family First-SIT will promote reliable, accurate, transparent, and timely two-way communication with CW workforce and stakeholders;

• integration – implementation is aligned with the CFSP, PIP, IV-E Plan, and the Oklahoma Practice Model; and

• implementation science – the implementation plan will be continually monitored and adjusted to meet emerging needs, and updates to the plan will be communicated on a regular basis.

This structure, guided by those four key principles, will lead to a stronger and better-aligned CW workforce that will contribute to the sustainability of a comprehensive, continuum of prevention and community-based supports and services for children and families toward ensuring strong and healthy well-being of children and strengthening families. This approach will lead to better outcomes related to the child's safety, permanency, or well-being or prevent the child from entering foster care. In collaboration with the Family First-SIT, a training and support plan will be developed to support the implementation and sustainability of the Title IV-E Prevention Program.

The current OKDHS CW policies were reviewed in planning for and developing the Title IV-E Prevention Program and Plan to assure that they met the statutory requirements of Family First. The integration of Family First into policy was completed previously in 2020, however policy revisions were required to incorporate and establish the Oklahoma Title IV-E Prevention Program. This plan has referenced statutory and/or policy reference and citations for the affected federal requirement within and attached are the full proposed revisions to existing policies. (See Appendix F. OKDHS OAC Chapter 75 CWS Proposed Policy Amendments). In the event, upon approval of the Oklahoma Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan further modifications are needed they will be made at that time.

# SECTION 8: PREVENTION CASELOADS

A caseload standard for OKDHS CW workforce was established as a result of the Oklahoma Pinnacle Plan, the state improvement plan from the 2012 class action lawsuit, DG vs. Yarbrough. The standard FCS caseload is no more than eight families per CW specialist, and for a PP caseload the standard is 15 children. Each CW supervisor has a maximum of five direct reports. Caseloads are a Pinnacle Plan measure that OKDHS tracks and reports on through semi-annual summary reports as part of the settlement agreement and has deployed strategies aimed to meet caseload standards. The target set to achieve is 90 percent, and for two consecutive reporting periods OKDHS achieved that target. As of December 31, 2020, 94.2 percent or 1,433 of 1,522 CW specialists were meeting caseload standards.

In addition to the caseload standards strategies in place, CWS has a prevention infrastructure in which policy, procedures, and practices support and align with the state's CFSP vision and goals to serve children and families preventively, as well as continued strategies outlined in the CFSP toward ensuring the safety, permanency and well-being of children in foster care. Therefore, OKDHS is anticipating no impact to FCS or PP caseloads, the number of children or families assigned to a CW specialist, from the Title IV-E Prevention Program implementation. Minimal impact on CW specialist and supervisor workloads is initially anticipated as they determine eligibility based on the selected candidate populations, document the foster care prevention strategy for the child identified as a candidate for foster care or a pregnant or parenting youth in a prevention plan, as well as ensure the identified prevention services that meet the needs of the child, parents or kin caregivers, and a pregnant or parenting youth are documented in the prevention plan.

Thorough planning, in partnership with stakeholders, took place to align the Title IV-E Prevention Program with the goals, objectives, and programmatic strategies in the OKDHS CFSP (2020-2024) to continue developing pathways to strengthen families, keep children safely in their own homes, decrease the number of family disruptions by increasing prevention efforts, and prevent child maltreatment. This also includes aligning with existing policy, procedures and practices to streamline processes and documents to reduce the burden on families and staff.

As prevention practices improve by building capacity to accurately identify safety threats and improve safety and intervention decision-making that leads to more families served in FCS and decreasing the need for foster care as an intervention, caseloads are expected to shift for PP to accommodate serving more children and families through FCS as fewer children will need foster care. CWS continues to utilize multiple strategies to improve prevention practices, and enhance and expand the prevention services and supports for children and families, while creating a child and family well-being network.

OKDHS envisions over the next five-year period, pending the influence of Medicaid expansion and Managed Care on prevention services provision, CWS will experience this shift and will adjust as needed to continue to prevent maltreatment and the removal of children from their families, and improve the safety, permanency and well-being for children and families. CWS will continue to monitor and oversee caseload standards.

through the reported measure in the Pinnacle Plan and ongoing CQI practices, as well as regular agency-wide performance monitoring activities.

As previously indicated in other sections of this plan, CWS provides services through a case management structure to provide ongoing case management and supports to ensure the continued safety of the child and pathways to enhance family functioning, and link through referral, access to prevention and intervention-related culturally-relevant, community-based services.

OKDHS partners contractually with providers to administer the selected Title IV-E prevention services. The contracted provider caseloads are determined, managed and overseen by the contracted provider, and consistent with the EBP program delivery, intensity and service setting. The contract sets forth the contractor's responsibility in ensuring caseload size consistent with the model approach and is monitored through CWS Programs.

CWS Programs partners with the contract providers, per policy, OAC 340:75-1-151.1, 75-151.2, 75-1-152, 75-1-152.5, to ensure program capacity is sufficient to meet the needs of children and families.

# GOALS

- Equip and empower families to provide a safe home for their children. Decrease the number of unnecessary family disruptions by increasing prevention efforts in order to strengthen families, prevent child maltreatment, and keep children safely in their own homes.
- If children enter foster care, understand and meet their specific needs. This includes their need for safety, connections with family, community and culture, and addressing health, behavioral health, developmental, and educational needs.
- The belief that every child and youth deserves a family and the supports they need to grow and develop; when a non‐family‐based placement is needed, ensure children are placed in the least restrictive, highest‐quality setting appropriate to their individual needs.
- Advance the implementation and sustainability of evidence‐based, trauma‐informed programs that appropriately and effectively improve child safety, ensure permanency, and promote child and family well‐being.
- Build capacity and leverage resources to provide effective services to prevent foster care placement while ensuring financial accountability.

# STRATEGIES

PS1: Strengthen the trauma‐informed, family‐centered services program, including prevention services planning, case management process, and practice guidance training focused on understanding and treating safety needs.FBP1: Increase the number of children placed in the care of relatives when removal from the home is necessary; including enhancement of supports and connections.NFBP1: Develop licensing requirements for non‐family‐based placements to attain status as a Qualified Residential Treatment Program (QRTP), defined as a program that:- Has a trauma‐informed treatment model- Has registered or licensed nursing staff or other licensed clinical staff providing care- Facilitates family outreach and participation in child’s treatment program- Provides discharge planning and family‐based aftercare supports- Is licensed and nationally accreditedEBP1: Promote the use of evidence‐based programs; if evidence‐based programs cannot be used, encourage programs at a minimum to collect quality data and follow research‐based standards to evaluate effectiveness.R1: Clearly define Maintenance of Effort (MOE) as it relates to FFPSAR2: Design and implement a fiscal auditing system for monitoring expenditures and assessing effectiveness of servicesR3: Promote partnerships to leverage and braid funding; repurpose funding streams to better meet the needs of children and familiesR4: Develop payment procedures in compliance with FFPSA, including procedure for IV‐E ineligible payments for prevention services and non‐family‐based placements

To achieve the Vision the implementation of the Family First Prevention Services Act will be grounded by four key principles:

- Data: Implementation will be done in a data‐driven manner, ensuring services developed and provided are informed by outcomes.
- Communication: Oklahoma Leadership and Family First‐SIT will promote reliable, accurate, transparent, and timely two‐way communication among all stakeholders.
- Integration: Family First implementation will be carefully aligned with the Child & Family Services Plan (CFSP), Process Improvement Plan (PIP), IV‐E Plan, and the Oklahoma Practice Model.
- Implementation Science: The Implementation Plan will be continually monitored and adjusted to meet emerging needs, and updates to the plan will be communicated on a regular basis.

1. (a) Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994 (MEPA) and the Interethnic Provisions of 1996 (IEP). MEPA as amended by IEP, eliminates discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin, in the placement of children in foster and adoptive resources, decreases the length of time children wait to be adopted, and facilitates the identification, recruitment, and retention of foster and adoptive parents who meet the distinctive needs of children awaiting placement. MEPA/IEP prohibits states or agencies receiving federal funds from delaying or denying the placement of a child on the basis of the race, color, or national origin of a child or the prospective foster or adoptive parent.
1. Placement considerations. Any consideration of race or ethnicity is narrowly tailored to advance the child's best interests and is made as an individualized determination for each child. The Oklahoma Department of Human Services (DHS) (OKDHS) may not delay or deny the placement of a child for adoption or foster care on the basis of the race, color, or national origin of the child or the adoptive or foster parent. A child who meets the definition of an "Indian child" per the Indian Child Welfare Act is placed according to the child's tribe's placement preferences, per Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC) 340:75-7-10, and 340:75-15-82, and 340:75-19-14.
2. Recruitment. MEPA/IEP requires that DHS OKDHS engage in active recruitment of potential foster and adoptive parents who reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of children in care needing placement.

recruitment plan is developed and updated annually, per OAC 340:75-7-10 and 340:75-15-82.

(b) Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) of 1997. ASFA amended Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. ASFA focuses on promoting child safety, timely decision-making as to permanency, and clarifying "reasonable efforts." Key provisions of the law include:

1. a provision that reasonable efforts to reunify a child with his or her parent or legal guardian are not required when a court determines that any of the conditions outlined in Section 1-4-809 of Title 10A of the Oklahoma Statutes exist;
2. directing the initiation of termination proceedings prior to the end of the 15th month, when a child was in out-of-home care for 15 of the most recent 22 months; and
3. a requirement that a permanency hearing is held no later than every 12 months after a child is placed in out-of-home care or 30-calendar days after a court determines that reasonable efforts to return a child to either parent are not required and, every 12 months thereafter.

(c) Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 amended Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act to connect and support relative caregivers, improve outcomes for children in foster care, provide for tribal foster care and adoption access, improve incentives for adoption, and for other purposes.

(d) Family First Prevention Services Act (FFPSA).

1. FFPSA amended Titles IV-B and IV-E of the Social Security Act to create the Title IV-E Prevention Program to recognize the importance of working with children and families to prevent the need for foster care placement and the trauma of unnecessary child-parent separation. The program is part of a broad vision of strengthening families by preventing:
1. (A) child maltreatment;
2. (B) unnecessary removal of children from their families; and
3. (C) homelessness among youth.
2. FFPSA authorized new optional Title IV-E funding, limited to up to 12 months, for prevention and treatment services for mental health and substance abuse and in-home parent skill-based programs that include parenting skills training, parent education, and individual and family counseling. The programs must be rated and approved by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse and identified in the state's five-year Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan for:
1. (A) a child who is a candidate for foster care;
2. (B) a pregnant or parenting foster youth; and
3. (C) the parents and/or kin caregivers of those children and youth.
3. A candidate for foster care in a Title IV-E prevention plan is identified as a child under 18 years of age at imminent risk of entering foster care, who can remain safely in his or her home or with kin caregivers with receipt of

approved Title IV-E prevention services necessary to prevent his or her entry into foster care. A candidate includes, but is not limited to:

1. a child with a substantiated allegation of abuse or neglect and the home is determined unsafe, but existing safety and risk factors can be mitigated through a Safety Plan, guardianship, non-custodial parent, or court oversight;
2. a child with a substantiated allegation of abuse or neglect and the home is determined safe, but the family behaviors, conditions, or situations have an "imminent risk" to manifest a threat to the child's safety;
3. a child with a sibling in foster care and the home's existing safety and risk factors can be mitigated;
4. a child reunified with his or her family following foster care and existing safety and risk factors, which would result in re-entry to foster care, can be mitigated; and
5. a child whose adoption or guardianship arrangement is at risk of disruption or dissolution and would result in a foster care placement.

(4) The Title IV-E Prevention Program is administered according to an approved state plan, per FFPSA, Public Law 115-123, Sections 471(e)(1) and 471(e)(5), that meets the child's, parent's, or kin caregiver's needs directly related to the child's safety, permanency, or well-being or to prevent the child from entering foster care. The state's Title IV-E Prevention Program Plan establishes:

1. a trauma-informed service-delivery framework;
2. the population served;
3. the Title IV-E prevention services that are provided, including how;

1. the services are continuously monitored to ensure fidelity;
2. the services are evaluated through a well-designed and rigorous process;
3. the specific child and family outcomes expected are to be achieved; and
