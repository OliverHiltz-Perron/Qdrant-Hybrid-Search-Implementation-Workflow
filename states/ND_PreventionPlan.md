# INTRODUCTION

North Dakota’s Child Welfare System is focusing on efforts to ensure availability and access to a broad, flexible array of effective, community-based services and supports for children and their families that address their emotional, social, educational, and physical needs, including traditional and nontraditional services as well as natural and informal supports.

|           Tribal Social Services          |                              |

In 2018, the ND Behavioral Health System Study conducted by Human Services Research Institute (HSRI) combined several past studies and utilized qualitative and quantitative data to develop a report with 65 separate recommendations for improving the behavioral health system. Twenty-five of the recommendations were specific to children and families with overarching goals to invest in prevention and early intervention efforts; ensure all North Dakotans have timely access to behavioral health services; expand outpatient and community-based services; and enhance and streamline the system of care for children and youth.

In the implementation of the recommendations, the North Dakota Department of Human Services is addressing the behavioral health needs by supporting the entire behavioral health continuum of care, increasing community-based services, and preventing criminal justice involvement for individuals with a behavioral health condition. These efforts include a Social Service Redesign, partnering with the Education System to develop cohesive strategies to address behavioral health in schools, expanding access to community-based behavioral health supports through 1915i Medicaid State Plan Amendment, the development of a voucher payment for substance use disorder treatment and recovery services with a.

recent expansion to include adolescents, the creation of a community behavioral health program focusing on families utilizing outcome based payments, the development of a Children’s Cabinet, the recent award of the System of Care Grant, expansion of targeted case management for youth with severe emotional disturbances, and the establishment of a Commission on Juvenile Justice.

# Implementation of FFPSA

In August of 2018, North Dakota began efforts to engage partners and stakeholders to implement the Family First Prevention Services Act (PL 115-132). These efforts included a collaboration among multiple entities including county social services, law enforcement agencies, legislators, foster parents and residential service providers. Other key partners included the North Dakota Division of Juvenile Services, North Dakota tribes, juvenile court, states attorneys and team members from various divisions within the Department of Human Services. Changes were made to North Dakota Century Code during the 2019-2020 legislative session and North Dakota Administrative Code was enacted October 1, 2019. The North Dakota Department of Human Services held nine monthly informational meetings in 2019 on the Family First Prevention Services Act (PL 115-123) to provide implementation updates to stakeholders and to give them an opportunity to ask questions and offer suggestions. Meetings were held on-site at the State Capitol, and a conference call line was also available for those unable to attend in person.

- Limitation on placements that are not in foster family homes:
- Legislative session updated North Dakota Century Code Chapter 50-11 to allow for licensing “on or near” an Indian reservation and increase the ND foster care bed capacity from four beds to six beds to be consistent with the national model standards.
- North Dakota completed the revision to the North Dakota Administrative Code Chapter 75-03-14 to enhance family foster care licensing. The national model standards were implemented in compliance on October 1, 2019.
- North Dakota Administrative Code Chapter 75-03-40 “Licensing of Qualified Residential Treatment Program (QRTP) providers was created to override and repeal the previous North Dakota Administrative Code Chapter 75-03-16 “Licensing of Residential Child Care and Group Homes (RCCF)”. QRTP level of care was in federal compliance on October 1, 2019.
- North Dakota Administrative Code Chapter 75-03-41 “Licensing of Supervised Independent Living (SIL) Programs” was created to offer the SIL level of care in state in federal compliance on October 1, 2019.
- Assessment and Documentation of the Need for Placement in a QRTP:
- The Department of Human Services has contracted with a third-party vendor, Maximus - Ascend, Inc., to complete a formal assessment via a Qualified Individual to approve or deny a child placement for treatment in a QRTP.
- ND Legislative session did have a law change (SB 2069) to expand the role of Juvenile Court Directors to approve placement of foster children in Qualified Residential Treatment Programs. CFS collaborated with ND Juvenile Court to align the Qualified Individual and Judicial Status Review Processes to be in compliance with FFPSA Federal Legislation, NDCC and NDAC (Juvenile Rule N.D.R.Proc.R. § 7). State court process and Tribal court processes are documented in foster care policy for QRTP. Court Improvement Project began efforts to train judges on the FFPSA regulations and the impact to the courts related to QRTP’s; additional training will be offered ongoing.
- The Ascend contract was signed in August 2019. The Department has met weekly with Ascend to assess, evaluate, review and discuss any concerns or procedural adjustments warranted. In addition, Ascend has provided webinars and face to face training to case managers, courts and QRTP providers.

Prevention programs. North Dakota plans to expand its services to include those approved as well-supported through the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse with the exception of Motivational Interviewing. Motivational Interviewing is being addressed in a statewide effort to train the child welfare system including tribal social services, private non-profit providers, juvenile correctional systems, and education through the development of learning communities. The service array will be expanded through plan amendments as additional evidence-based services are reviewed and approved through the Title IV-E prevention services clearinghouse authorized by the Children’s Bureau through ACYF-CB-PI-19-06.

# SECTION 1: SERVICE DESCRIPTION AND OVERSIGHT

Comprehensive Title IV-E prevention services for children and families in North Dakota will consist of the three allowable services of the FFPSA:

- In-Home Parent Skill-Based Programs
- Mental Health Treatment Programs
- Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Programs

The North Dakota Department of Human Services (NDDHS) is in the process of developing a web-based portal. Through this portal, individuals, or other referral sources such as private and public agencies, treatment providers, juvenile court, parents or caregivers will be able to submit the eligibility referral to determine foster care candidacy for Title IV-E prevention services. The goal of the portal will be to connect and identify the most appropriate program(s) the child and/or family member(s) may be eligible for. Community and private providers can apply through the NDDHS to become an approved provider to receive reimbursement through Title IV-E. The agency must identify what approved service, as identified in this plan, they will provide and submit proof they are trained and qualified to offer that service. As agencies are approved, a Provider Agreement will be signed with the NDDHS. The Provider Agreement assures the agency conducts all requirements set out by the NDDHS and Families First Prevention Services Act.

| In-Home        | Parent Skill- | Based      | Programs  |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Comprehensive  | Title IV-E    | Prevention | Services  |
| for Children & | Families      |            |           |
| Mental         | Health        | Programs   | Substance |
| Abuse          | Prevention    | & Treament |           |

In North Dakota, the defined population for Title IV-E prevention services includes a larger group of prospective candidates greater than just child welfare clients. North Dakota will extend prevention services to families earlier and more broadly. Therefore, North Dakota allows for any individual to complete the online application for Title IV-E eligibility. As the individual is filling out the application if the eligibility criteria does not meet Title IV-E requirements the system will stop the application from moving forward. The application requires the individual to identify the circumstances and characteristics of the child, parent/caregiver, or family that are likely to have an adverse impact on a child's development or functioning and these such characteristics or circumstances place them at increased risk for maltreatment, involvement with the child welfare system, and a candidate for foster care. The individual completing the application; parent, caregiver, case manager, service provider or other, is indicating known risk factors. In all cases, the parent/caregiver are aware of the application and are notified by NDDHS of the eligibility determination.

When an application is submitted, it is received and reviewed by the Title IV-E eligibility worker at NDDHS - Children and Family Services eligibility unit. The eligibility worker will approve, deny, or set the application to pending. If application is set to pending, a request is made to the applicant for more information to further support the eligibility determination on behalf of the child. If approved, the child is eligible to receive prevention services from an approved Title IV-E provider of the evidence-based models/program noted in the North Dakota Prevention Services Plan. These children would be defined as candidates for foster care. If during the review of an application the eligibility worker suspects a child is in present danger or is being abused or neglected, they will call or file a child abuse and neglect report SFN 960 to the Children and Family Services Child Protection centralized intake unit. The child protection services intake unit reviews all reports and then assigns them to the local Human Service Zone, as an authorized agent of the NDDHS.

The NDDHS developed a screening process for families that have been determined eligible but are not being served by a Title IV-E provider or human service zone. The screening process is completed by a

North Dakota Title IV-E Prevention Plan

trained screener. The screener assists the family in determining what prevention service best meets the needs of the family and makes a referral to the family’s selected provider.

In the cases where eligibility has been determined a Title IV-E provider or human service zone staff can consider the need and appropriateness of the specific prevention service and make direct referrals to the prevention service. Therefore, the family does not need to go through the NDDHS screening process, unless requested by the service provider.

When the family is not involved with or being served by a Title IV-E provider or human service zone staff the family will be directed to complete the screening process to determine what prevention service would best meet the needs of the family.

Every six months an eligibility review is completed if the child is still receiving a Title IV-E prevention service. The review is completed six months from the start of the prevention plan. The provider must submit the identified child’s Eligibility Review form and information from the child’s plan to support the determination of the child’s continued eligibility. The Eligibility Review form is submitted to the Title IV-E eligibility worker for approval or denial. If the service is stopped the prevention plan ends. If services are requested to start again, a new application will have to be completed.

Title IV-E prevention cases will be overseen and managed by the approved Title IV-E prevention service provider. The Title IV-E prevention service provider will maintain a prevention plan of the eligible child and parent/caregiver. If the prevention service provider is an individual but employed by an agency, ultimately the agency is required through the Provider Agreement to maintain compliance with all Title IV-E prevention and NDDHS requirements. On-going monitoring will be conducted to ensure compliance. If compliance concerns arise regarding the service provider not following the requirements of the Provider Agreement, NDDHS will assist the provider to bring them to compliance.

# In-Home Parent Skill-Based Programs

North Dakota saw a 52% increase in the number of children in foster care over the last ten years. Of the children in foster care, the percentage under the age of 5 years has steadily risen from 28% to 40% during the same timeframe (Figure 3.) North Dakota will build the service array of the approved well-supported In-home parent skill-based programs to target this population.

North Dakota Title IV-E Prevention Plan

# Through the Title IV-E Prevention Plan, North Dakota plans to expand/implement the following programs:

# Healthy Families

# Service Description

Healthy Families America (HFA) is a home visiting program for new and expectant families with children who are at-risk for maltreatment or adverse childhood experiences. HFA is a nationally accredited program that was developed by Prevent Child Abuse America. The overall goals of the program are to cultivate and strengthen nurturing parent-child relationships, promote healthy childhood growth and development, and enhance family functioning by reducing risk and building protective factors. HFA includes screening and assessments to identify families most in need of services, offering intensive, long-term and culturally responsive services to both parent(s) and children, and linking families to a medical provider and other community services as needed. Healthy Families North Dakota (HFND) offers services until the child is five years old. During the first six months following a child’s birth or following enrollment (whichever is later), in-home visits are offered weekly. After six months, families receive visits less frequently depending on their needs and progress.

# Level of Evidence

Well-Supported (by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse)

# Service Category

In-Home Parent Skills-Based Programs and Services

# Version of Book or Manual

Healthy Families North Dakota (HFND) has been approved by Healthy Families America (HFA) for adaptation. The adaptation allows for enrollment of a child up to age 2 years, when the family is involved with the child welfare system. This approved adaptation will also be implemented with this plan. The Healthy Families America Site Development Guide (rev. 2014) is a guidebook that provides information for sites on planning, developing, and implementing an HFA site. The HFA Best Practice Standards (rev. 2017) offer specific guidelines on HFA model implementation.

# Plan to Implement

Healthy Families North Dakota is in 11 counties of the state. HFND has targeted at risk children through 20 years of providing services in the state. Through the expansion, HFND will engage families directly involved in the child welfare system that qualify as a prevention candidate. North Dakota’s plan for implementation includes:

- Providers apply to be an approved IV-E prevention services provider.
- Establish contracts with qualified provider, using billing codes to capture required client and payment data.

# Outcome Expected to Improve

Consistent with the outcomes identified as having a positive effect through the independent review of research conducted by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse for HFA, North Dakota expects to see the following outcomes for children and families receiving this service:

- Reduce child maltreatment
- Improve parent-child interactions and children’s social-emotional well-being
- Increase school readiness
- Promote child physical health and development
- Promote positive parenting
- Promote self-sufficiency
- Increase access to primary care medical services and community services
- Decrease child injuries and emergency department use

North Dakota Title IV-E Prevention Plan

# Program specific outcomes

Program specific outcomes are entered by the providers using the Title IV-E Prevention Services: Child/Family Outcomes Survey. The survey data is submitted monthly to the state by the providers. The state collects this data and will use it for CQI. By employing the CQI Cycle, the State can monitor the effectiveness of the program and make needed programmatic adjustment to reach the desired outcomes. For the Healthy Families program ND will target the following outcomes for CQI:

- Reduce child maltreatment
- Improve parent-child interactions
- Promote positive parenting

# Plan to Monitor for Fidelity

North Dakota will conduct ongoing contract monitoring to ensure HFND’s fidelity to the model and progress measures meet the standards established. HFND must meet the threshold of national accreditation. Completion of this process is required to confirm fidelity to the Model as set forth by HFA.

- Collect and analyze data for outcome and process measures and for required reporting.
- Evaluate the outcome measurement to identify strengths and weaknesses and incorporate this information into improvement plans, service design improvement process, quality monitoring and technical assistance.

# How Selected

A multi-disciplinary Title IV-E Prevention Services Planning Workgroup made up of subject matter experts from the child welfare system including children and family services, human services, juvenile justice, and behavioral health reviewed the current inventory of the approved well-supported evidence-based prevention programs in North Dakota and selected HFA to be included in the state’s prevention service array.

# Target Population

Families are eligible to receive Healthy Families services beginning at birth or within three months of birth. When referred from child welfare, families may be enrolled with a child up to twenty-four months of age. This program is designed to serve the families of children who have increased risk for maltreatment or other adverse childhood experiences.

# Assurance for Trauma Informed Service Delivery

HFND requires that all staff participate in HFA Core Training, which is aligned with 3 major principles: 1) trauma-informed 2) attachment/relationship focused, and 3) grounded in reflective practice. Additionally, all staff receive intensive training on using the evidence-based curriculum, Growing Great Kids, and are required to participate in NEAR (Neuroscience, Epigenetics, Adverse Childhood Experience and Resilience) training, which supports the understanding of trauma and its impacts.

# How Evaluated

HFND will include the required participation in a self-study, national peer-reviewed site visit, implement a quality assurance plan, and subsequent quality improvement efforts in order to continue to meet the threshold of accreditation. Completion of this process is required to confirm fidelity to the Model as set forth by HFA.

North Dakota is requesting a waiver for evaluation of HFA, which has been designated by the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse as “Well-Supported.” See Appendix B: State Request for Waiver of Evaluation Requirement for a Well-Supported Practice

Parents as Teachers

# Service Description

Parents as Teachers (PAT) is a home-visiting parent education program that teaches new and expectant parents skills intended to promote positive child development and prevent child maltreatment. PAT aims to increase parent knowledge of early childhood development, improve parenting practices, promote early detection of developmental delays and health issues, prevent child abuse and neglect, and increase school readiness and success. The PAT model includes four core components:

- Personal home visits,
- Supportive group connection events,
- Child health and developmental screenings, and
- Community resource networks.

PAT is designed so that it can be delivered to diverse families with diverse needs, although PAT sites typically target families with specific risk factors. Families can begin the program prenatally and continue through when their child enters kindergarten. Services are offered on a biweekly or monthly basis, depending on family needs. Sessions are typically held for one hour in the family’s home, but can also be delivered in schools, child-care centers, or other community spaces. Each participant is assigned a parent educator who must have a high school degree or GED with two or more years of experience working with children and parents. Parent educators must also attend five days of PAT training. North Dakota participates in the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program, which funds the Parents as Teachers program at Turtle Mountain Nations in North Dakota, through Prevent Child Abuse North Dakota (PCAND).

Program specific outcomes are entered by the providers using the Title IV-E Prevention Services: Child/Family Outcomes Survey. The survey data is submitted monthly to the state by the providers. The state collects this data and will use it for CQI. By employing the CQI Cycle, the State can monitor the effectiveness of the program and make needed programmatic adjustment to reach the desired outcomes. For the Parents as Teachers program ND will target the following outcomes for CQI:

- Increased child safety
- Increased positive parenting practices

# Plan to Monitor for Fidelity

The PAT program will maintain fidelity to its model by implementing and replicating the 20 fundamental and essential requirements set out by the Parents as Teachers National Center. North Dakota will conduct ongoing contract monitoring to ensure PAT’s fidelity to the model and progress measures meet the standards established.

# How Selected

A multi-disciplinary Title IV-E Prevention Services Planning Workgroup made up of subject matter experts from the child welfare system including children and family services, human services, juvenile justice, and behavioral health reviewed the current inventory of the approved well-supported evidence-based prevention programs in North Dakota and selected PAT to be included in the state’s prevention service array.

# Brief Strategic Family Therapy

# Service Description

Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT) uses a structured family systems approach to treat families with children or adolescents 6 to 17 years old who display or are at risk for developing problem behaviors including substance abuse, conduct problems, and delinquency. There are three interventions components; (1) counselors establish relationships with family members to better understand and join the family system; (2) counselors observe how family members behave with one another in order to identify interactional patterns that are associated with problematic youth behavior; and (3) counselors work in the present, using reframes, assigning tasks and coaching family members to try new ways of relating to one another to promote more effective and adaptive family interactions. BSFT is delivered by trained therapists and are required to participate in four phases of training and are expected to have training and/or experience with basic clinical skills common to many behavioral intervention and family systems theory. BSFT is typically delivered in 12 to 16 weekly sessions in community centers, clinics, health agencies, or homes.

# Functional Family Therapy

# Service Description

Functional Family Therapy (FFT) is a short-term prevention program for at-risk youth and their families. FFT aims to address risk and protective factors that impact the adaptive development of 11 to 18-year-old youth who have been referred for behavioral or emotional problems. The program is organized in five phases that consist of: (1) developing a positive relationship between therapist/program and family; (2) increasing hope for change and decrease blame/conflict; (3) identifying specific needs and characteristics of the family; (4) supporting individual skill-building of youth and family; and (5) generalizing changes to a broader context. Typically, therapists will meet with the family face-to-face for at least 90 minutes per week and for 30 minutes over the phone, over an average of three to five months. Master’s level therapists provide FFT, are part of an FFT-supervised unit and receive ongoing support from their local unit and FFT LLC.

# Multisystemic Therapy

# Service Description

Multisystemic Therapy (MST) is an intensive family and community-based treatment program for youth 12 to 17 years old delivered in multiple settings. This program aims to promote pro-social behavior and reduce criminal activity, mental health symptomology, out-of-home placements, and substance use in youth. The MST program addresses the core causes of delinquent and antisocial conduct by identifying key drivers of the behaviors through an ecological assessment of the youth, his or her family, and school and community. The intervention strategies are personalized to address the identified drivers. The program is delivered for an average of three to five months, and services are available 24/7, which enables timely crisis management and allows families to choose which times will work best for them. Master’s level therapists from licensed MST providers take on only a small caseload at any given time so that they can be available to meet their clients’ needs.

# Parent Child Interaction Therapy

# Service Description

Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is a program for two to seven-year old children and their parents or caregivers that aims to decrease externalizing child behavior problems, increase positive parenting behaviors, and improve the quality of the parent-child relationship. During weekly sessions, therapists coach parents and caregivers in skills such as child centered play, communication, increasing child compliance, and problem-solving. Therapists use “bug-in-the-ear” technology to provide live coaching to parents and caregivers from behind a one way mirror or with same room coaching. Parents and caregivers progress through treatment as they master specific competencies, thus, there is no fixed length of treatment. Most families can achieve mastery of the program content in 12 to 20 one-hour sessions. Master’s level therapists who have received specialized training provide PCIT services to children and their parents or caregivers.

The Family Check Up (FCU)
# Service Description

The Family Check-Up® model is a brief, strengths-based intervention for families with children ages 2 through 17. The intervention aims to promote positive family management and can address child and adolescent emotional, behavioral and academic concerns. The Family Check-Up® has two phases: 1.) An initial assessment and feedback and 2.) Parent management training.

Phase one includes three main components: (1) an initial interview that involves rapport building and motivational interviewing to explore parental strengths and challenges related to parenting and the family context; (2) an ecological family assessment that includes parent and child questionnaires, a teacher questionnaire for children that are in school, and a videotaped observation of family interactions; and (3) tailored feedback that involves reviewing assessment results and discussing follow-up service options for the family. Follow up services will include Everyday Parenting and may include clinical or other support services in the community.

Phase two is parent management training. North Dakota will require Everyday Parenting as its designated parent management training. Everyday Parenting is a skills-based curriculum designed to support development of positive parenting skills. The curriculum is modular, and sessions can be tailored to the family’s specific needs and readiness based on the FCU assessment.

The Family Check-Up® can be delivered in a variety of settings, including in the home, schools, community mental health settings, health centers, hospitals, primary care, and Native American tribal communities.

# Decreased child behaviors problems

# Plan to Monitor for Fidelity

North Dakota will conduct ongoing contract monitoring to ensure FCU’s fidelity to the model and that outcome measurements meet the standards established.

Fidelity monitoring is the responsibility of the provider, which is noted in the Title IV-E Services Provider Agreement. To be eligible for the Title IV-E Prevention Services Program, providers must agree to follow the fidelity practices of the Title IV-E prevention service model being provided. The Family Check-Up requires providers to maintain at least one Certified Supervisor/Trainer on staff at the agency and demonstrate the use of the COACH tools for fidelity measurement. The COACH tool should be used in line with other supervisory activity, as often as needed depending on the strength of the practitioner and volume of families being served.

# How Selected

The FCU was brought to the state’s attention by a private provider in the state. The provider was looking for the state to invest in a program that would provide services and supports similar to home visiting for families with older children. The FCU program was brought to the multi-disciplinary Title IV-E Prevention Services Planning Workgroup, made up of subject matter experts from child welfare, behavioral health, and juvenile justice. The workgroup supported the addition of The FCU to be included in the state’s prevention service array.

# Target Population

The FCU is appropriate for families with children who are between the ages of 2 and 17. The intervention is targeted for families in need of parenting skills and family management practices and/or families with children with emotional and behavioral problems. The intervention aims to improve positive parenting skills, family management practices and improve emotional and behavioral child outcomes.

# SECTION 2: EVALUATION STRATEGY AND WAIVER REQUEST

North Dakota is committed to implementing prevention services that have compelling evidence of their effectiveness. This will help ensure that families are provided services that will help to keep them from moving further into the child welfare system. At the time of this submission, North Dakota will only be implementing well-supported practices and will be requesting waivers to the evaluation requirement.

The North Dakota Department of Human Services (NDDHS) will implement a Continuous Quality Improvement process (CQI) that will include outcomes measured by both DHS and providers to monitor activities provided under the Title IV-E Prevention Plan. This CQI process will be used to ensure that participants are provided quality services that protect the safety and health of every child and family and to determine the impact of those services on child and family level outcomes and functioning. This process will involve participation from the DHS, private/community providers, children and families and other community stakeholders.

NDDHS (the State Title IV-E agency) will require a Provider Agreement with each provider that is approved to provide services under the Title IV-E Prevention Plan. This Provider Agreement is vital to ensure NDDHS oversight and will be used to ensure the collection and submission of outcomes to demonstrate that providers can meet positive outcomes for children and families. Providers will be required to follow the fidelity practices of the selected evidence-based practice interventions. As services are delivered, providers must implement fidelity monitoring procedures as delineated for the program.

Providers need to submit a plan outlining their fidelity review process to include how they will facilitate fidelity reviews, work toward quality improvement, and maintain records of the continuous quality improvement procedures. Fidelity review documentation will be reviewed by NDDHS upon request or during audit reviews as part of the utilization review process. Providers must collect and report on outcomes including but not limited to economic stability, social and community context, neighborhood and environment, healthcare, and education. Outcomes will be collected at a minimum every three months and submitted by required deadlines as outlined in the Provider Agreement. NDDHS will monitor and review outcomes submitted. If outcome measures are not achieved, the provider may be required to submit an action plan that will be reviewed by NDDHS. NDDHS will facilitate utilization review, providers will be required to submit requested documentation and participate in trainings, technical assistance and other meetings as requested by NDDHS.

As part of the CQI process and ongoing monitoring, NDDHS will develop a review of programs and services to assist with determining the impact the services have on child/family outcomes and functioning to determine the effectiveness of current processes and systems. This information will be used to identify strengths and needs in implementation within and across providers in support of quality improvement. Technical assistance will be available to providers as needed to provide support in this area. Reviews will involve verification of fidelity and outcome measurement processes. Outcomes measured at the NDDHS level will include items such as safety, permanency (including entry into foster care) and family well-being. Provider and state level data will be used to evaluate trends and to refine and improve practices. NDDHS will meet regularly to review and evaluate CQI outcomes and will communicate with stakeholders and decision makers as needed to refine and improve practices. NDDHS will utilize the theory of constraints model to streamline processes and efficiencies involved in administration and operations.

# Continuous Quality Improvement

North Dakota believes that a fully functioning statewide Continuous Quality Improvement process will provide strategies to effectively address child welfare practice concerns and establish ongoing protocols for checks and balances within the system. North Dakota has chosen the Theory of Constraints (TOC) as the model for a statewide CQI process across all divisions within the North Dakota Department of Human Services.

Theory of Constraints (TOC) is a methodology for identifying the most important limiting factor (i.e. constraint) that stands in the way of achieving a goal and then systematically improving that constraint.

---

North Dakota Title IV-E Prevention Plan
# Theory of Constraints

until it is no longer the limiting factor. TOC focuses on how quickly results can be achieved, referred to as “throughput”. On the other hand, theory of constraints focuses on the factors that hinder the speed of this “throughput”, referred to as a bottleneck. The “throughput” will be increased when the “bottleneck” can be reinforced or eliminated. Generally, there are five steps that are followed when working with TOC:

1. Identify the system constraints: The weakest link in an organization is identified whereupon it must be decided whether its causes are physical, or policy related.
2. Decide how to exploit the constraint: The organization determines how this constraint can be eliminated as a result of which the “throughput” can be increased. Should these actions not lead to an increase, it is considered advisable to abandon the breakthrough of this constraint.
3. Subordinate everything else to the above decision: The organization as a whole must side with the adopted solution, as a result of which the “constraint” is solved. It is wise to make an assessment in between steps 3 and 4, to establish whether performance is still being hindered by this earlier constraint.
4. Elevate performance of the constraint: Other adjustments can be used to break through the “constraints”. This could involve changes in the existing system (reorganization) or changes in the market. Such adjustments require investments and will only be deployed after all other options have been considered.
5. Continuous process: After the implementation of the opted solution and after elimination or breakthrough of the constraint, the process starts over again from Step 1. On the one hand the impact of the implemented solution is looked at and on the other hand new constraints are identified and broken through.

The following graphic shows how Theory of Constraints (outer ring of arrows) shares much of the same processes with the traditional continuous quality improvement cycle (inner grouping of arrow wedges). Both processes start with identification of the problem or constraint. The next step with TOC is Exploiting the Constraint. This corresponds with the CQI steps of Researching the Solution, Developing the Theory of Change, and Adapting or Developing the Solution. The third and fourth steps of TOC call for Subordination to the Constraint and Elevation of the Constraint, which corresponds with the CQI step of Implementing the Solution. The last steps of both cycles involve analyzing the solution and, if needed, making further changes by going through the cycle again.

With Theory of Constraints, it is important to look at one constraint per cycle. By focusing all attention on one constraint, it can be dealt with more adequately rather than diluting focus across multiple issues. The other links in the system are regarded as non-constraints and are therefore not reinforced or broken through. Reinforcement or breakthrough of the identified constraint will automatically lead to another constraint that will have to be identified again. And like the CQI cycle, the whole TOC process starts over again. Therefore, the Theory of Constraints encourages an organization to improve its system continuously: it is a continuous quality improvement process.

# Theory of Constraints Focusing Steps

Continue Process:

1. Identify the Constraint
2. Monitor and Understand
3. Implement Research Ine
4. Elevate the Constraint
5. Exploit the Constraint
6. Subordinate to Constraint

As depicted in the above graphic, the CFS Management Team oversees the quality improvement activities for the public child welfare system in North Dakota. This team includes the Division Director, Assistant Division Director/CQI Administrator, QA Unit Manager, Safety Administrator, Permanency Administrator, Wellbeing Administrator, and the Early Childhood Services Administrator. Not only does this allow for ongoing and timely review of data and progress made on the system change goals, it allows for more timely adjustment to be made to programs.

Essential to a well-functioning continuous quality improvement (CQI) system is building productive CQI teams and ensuring that information generated through the system will be effectively used to make needed improvements. A productive CQI system requires a mechanism that promotes circular feedback and communication among staff, stakeholders, and teams (depicted by the dashed line in the graphic above). These feedback loops permit an ongoing, bi-directional information exchange across all levels of the agency, which in turn facilitates the change process. Equally important is sharing data with agency staff and sharing data with consumers and external stakeholders.

To help move needed system changes forward, subcommittees are established as needed (refer to the above graphic). This will include permanent regional subcommittees. The regional CQI specialist will oversee the subcommittee. Membership will include representation from public and private entities participating in the public child welfare system throughout the region including:

- Human service zones;
- Tribal social services;
- Criminal justice;
- Private agencies;
- Family members.


North Dakota Title IV-E Prevention Plan

North Dakota Title IV-E Prevention Plan

The subcommittees will work closely with the CFS Management Team to identify systemic issues impacting service delivery and develop processes to improve outcomes for the identified service area. They will:

- Review data from various sources including project specific data, CFSR/QA data and regional/local data reports;
- Review regional Onsite Case Review (OCR) data and discusses regional initiatives or action plans to address areas needing improvement;
- Design and implement CQI projects to improve outcomes throughout the regional service delivery system and ultimately the statewide public child welfare system;
- Provide ongoing consultation and collaboration to review and evaluate the progress of the PIP strategies and CFSP goals and recommend program adjustments to allow for successful completion of the requirements of the CFSR performance improvement plan;
- Provide for or arrange for ongoing training for individual workers on CQI principles;
- Promoting a culture that values service quality and continual efforts by the Team, its partners, and contractors to achieve strong performance, program goals, and positive results for service recipients;
- Make legislative/policy/and practice improvement recommendations to the CQI Council.

North Dakota has been using TOC as its continuous quality improvement program to improve services and outcomes. An example is the project looking at Child Protective Services. Key stakeholders came together to redesign Child Protective Services (CPS) to provide individuals and families the right service at the right time, at the right frequency and intensity. Three goals were identified as part of the CPS redesign project:

- Reduce the time it takes to complete a CPS assessment.
- Conduct a face to face meeting with the identified child within 3 days.
- Conduct complete casework 100% of the time, only passing on completed casework.

Current North Dakota statute requires that CPS assessments be completed within 62 days. Regretfully, this was only occurring 48% of the time during a 12-month assessment period. The CPS redesign Pilot Project targets are:

- 50% of CPS assessments completed at 25 days
- 75% of CPS assessments completed at 35 days
- 95% of CPS assessments completed at 62 days

Preliminary pilot project data shows progress including:

- 89% of the cases were closed with 62 days (baseline was 40.8%)
- 56% of the 499 closed cases were closed within 25 days (baseline was 7.35%)
- 89% of CPS workers met face-to-face with the identified child within three days of the report, sooner if imminent concerns were identified
- Pilot regions have, in some cases, unlocked hidden capacity, increasing access to services, and transferring staff from administrative work to direct client services.

North Dakota is in the second year of a performance improvement plan for the Round 3 CFSR. Goal One of the PIP involves strengthening its QA/CQI processes. Recently, North Dakota began receiving technical assistance from the Capacity Building Center for States. The goal of the TA is to develop and implement a CQI system that not only fulfills PIP requirements but also integrates the Theory of Constraints and includes all the functional components of an effective CQI system. Practice changes would include:

- Improved engagement of key stakeholders in the generation and meaning-making of performance data at the state, regional, and case-levels
- Improved use of data and evidence in decision-making at the state, regional, and case level

Page 30

---


•   Deeper collaboration and partnership between state and regional staff in identifying performance issues, unearthing root causes, developing and implementing improvement strategies, and monitoring their effectiveness.

North Dakota will use this CQI process to evaluate and continually improve provision of Title IV-E prevention services.

# Evaluation Design:

North Dakota does not intend to implement any allowable supported or promising practice evidence-based practices for consideration under FFPSA at the time of this submission. Rather, the State will only leverage FFPSA funding for well-supported models in year one of implementation (see Table 1 below). Therefore, an evaluation description is not needed at this time. As additional services are added to the Clearinghouse list of well-supported, the State may submit amendments to its plan along with appropriate waiver requests or full evaluation design (for supported or promising models).

# Waiver Request:

Based on the compelling evidence for each program described above – as identified in the Extend of Evidence and Summary of Finding found within the documentation in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse. North Dakota is submitting Appendix B, Request for Waiver of Evaluation Requirement for each Well-Supported Practice.

# Compelling Evidence

Brief Strategic Family Therapy:  The request for a waiver of the evaluation requirement for Brief Strategic Family Therapy is based on compelling evidence that families in BSFT 1) had higher rates of engagement, retention and were more likely both to engage 2) adolescents of parents who used drugs at baseline had a significantly lower trajectory of substance use 3) decrease of parental alcohol usage. The following summary of research highlights the compelling evidence:

The effects of Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT) on parent substance use and the association between parent and adolescent substance use. Addictive Behaviors, 42, 44-50. This study is a secondary analysis to determine the effects of Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT) on parent substance use, and the relationship between parent substance use and adolescent substance use. This paper uses data from the BSFT effectiveness study conducted in the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network. Participants were randomized to BSFT or treatment as usual (TAU) across eight outpatient treatment programs community treatment programs (CTPs) across the country. Adolescent substance use was assessed at baseline and at 12 monthly follow-up assessments. All additional adolescent and family assessments were completed at baseline and 4-, 8-, and 12-months post-randomization. Parent alcohol and drug use were assessed at baseline and at 12 months post-

randomization. Measures utilized include the Alcohol and Drug Use items from the Addiction Severity Index-Lite (ASI), the Timeline Follow Back (TLFB), C-Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Substance Abuse/Dependence Module (DISC-SA), Parenting Practices Questionnaire, and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Predictive Scales (DISC-PS).

# Outcome

Results found parents in BSFT significantly decreased their alcohol use as measured by the ASI composite score from baseline to 12 months. Change in family functioning mediated the relationship between treatment condition and change in parent alcohol use. Children of parents who reported drug use at baseline had three times as many days of reported substance use at baseline compared with children of parents who did not use or only used alcohol. Adolescents of parents who used drugs at baseline in the BSFT group had a significantly lower trajectory of substance use than adolescents in the TAU group.

Brief Strategic Family Therapy versus community control: Engagement, retention, and an exploration of the moderating role of adolescent symptom severity. Family Process, 40(3), 313-332. This study aimed to extend the body of research investigating the effectiveness of Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT) to engage and retain families and/or youth in treatment. The sample reported in this article was part of a large-scale, two-phase demonstration study testing the efficacy of BSFT with high-risk minority youth (first-phase: see above summary of Santisteban, Coatsworth, Perez-Vidal et al., 1997). 104 families were randomly assigned to BSFT or a community comparison (CC) condition selected to represent the common engagement and treatment practices of the community. The Revised Behavior Problem Checklist (RBPC), an empirically derived measure consisting of 89 problem behaviors, was administered. A primary limitation of the study was that an intent-to-treat design was not able to be fully implemented. While the experimenters were able to complete termination assessments for 77% of the families that participated in either treatment, limited resources restricted the ability to track and assess families that did not engage into treatment.

# Outcome

Results indicated that the families assigned to BSFT had significantly higher rates of engagement (81% vs. 61%) and retention (71% vs. 42%) than those assigned to CC. A risk-ratio analysis revealed that families randomized into BSFT were 2.3 times more likely both to engage and to retain than families/participants randomized to CC condition. BSFT was also more effective than CC in retaining more severe cases, specifically cases with high levels of adolescent conduct disorder, and, despite the higher percentage of difficult-to-treat cases, achieved comparable treatment effects on behavior problems.

Szapocznik, J., Perez-Vidal, A., Brickman, A., Foote, F. H., Santisteban, D., Hervis, O. E. & Kurtines, W. M. (1988). Engaging adolescent drug abusers and their families in treatment: A strategic structural systems approach. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 56(4), 552. Using a two-group experimental design, this study randomly assigned subjects to either strategic structural-systems engagement (SSSE) or engagement as usual (EAU). SSSE was developed within the conceptual framework of Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT) (Szapocznik, Kurtines, et al., 1983, 1986), which is a structural family-systems approach. This study tested the efficacy of the strategic structural systems engagement procedure for engaging hard-to-reach cases and bringing them to therapy completion. To assess the subject’s psychiatric and psychosocial functioning, the Psychiatric Status Schedule (PSS) was one of the measures used. Another measure used was the Client-Oriented Data Acquisition Process (CODAP), which requests information on drug use by type and frequency.

# Outcome

A sustained higher level of engagement was found in the SSSE condition vs. the EAU condition. For example, over 57.7% of the families in the EAU condition failed to come to the center for intake, while only 7.1% of families in the SSSE condition were lost.

The goal of BSFT is to improve a youth’s behavior by improving family interactions that are presumed to be directly related to the child’s symptoms, thus reducing risk factors and strengthening protective factors for adolescent drug abuse and other conduct problems. BSFT targets children and adolescents who are displaying—or are at risk for developing—behavior problems, including substance abuse. Review of the research suggests that implementing the model in community settings in North Dakota will provide therapists with an effective tool to increase family involvement in therapy, increase retention, reduce

Adolescent drug use and related risk-taking behaviors, and reconfigure family interactions to support healthy development. This will help North Dakota realize the goal of decreased out-of-home placements.

# Functional Family Therapy

The evidence in favor of the use of Functional Family Therapy in North Dakota to provide change in family interactions and subsequent behavior. The request for a waiver of the evaluation requirement for FFT is based on compelling evidence that 1) FFT has shown to improve family dynamics; 2) decrease delinquent behavior in youth; and 3) decrease the recidivism rate of delinquent teenagers. The following summary of research highlights the compelling evidence:

# Study: Alexander J. F., & Parsons, B. V. (1973)

Short-term behavioral intervention with delinquent families: Impact on family process and recidivism. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 81(3), 219-225. This study examined the impact of a short-term behavioral intervention [now called Functional Family Therapy (FFT)] on the recidivism rates of delinquent teenagers and their families. Families were randomly assigned to either the short-term behavioral family intervention program or to one of three comparison groups: client-centered family groups program, psychodynamic family program (Mormon church-sponsored), or a no-treatment control group. Juvenile court records were examined following termination to assess recidivism, (i.e., referral for behavioral offense).

Outcome: Short-term family behavioral treatment had a 26% recidivism rate. No-treatment control group had a 50% recidivism rate, the client-centered family group had a 47% recidivism rate, the psychodynamic family treatment group had a 73% recidivism rate.

# Study: Klein, N., Alexander, J., & Parsons, B. (1977)

Impact of family systems intervention on recidivism and sibling delinquency: A model of primary prevention and program evaluation. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 45(3), 469-474. Measured outcomes on three levels of evaluation: changes in the family interaction process at the termination of treatment (tertiary prevention); recidivism rates 6 to 18 months following treatment (secondary prevention); and rate of sibling contact with the court 2.5 to 3.5 years following intervention (primary prevention). Families were randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions: the treatment program [now called Functional Family Therapy (FFT)], one of two comparison groups, or a no-treatment control group.

Outcome: The family systems approach, when compared to the other conditions, produced significant improvements in family interaction process measures and a significant reduction in recidivism. Siblings of youth receiving FFT showed lower arrest rates than siblings from alternative treatment conditions 2 ½ to 3 ½ years post-treatment.

# Study: Waldron, H. B., Slesnick, N., Brody, J. L., Peterson, T. R., & Turner, C. W. (2001)

Treatment outcomes for adolescent substance abuse at 4- and 7-month assessments, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 69(5), 802-813. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions: Functional Family Therapy (FFT), individual Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), a combination of FFT and CBT (joint), or a psychoeducational group. Measures to assess substance abuse included the Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) interview, as well as collateral reports from parents and siblings of adolescents, and urinalyses. In order to assess problem behaviors that may be associated with substance abuse, the Problem Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers (POSIT) and Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) were used.

Outcome: Therapy conditions (FFT and joint CBT/FFT) had significant reductions in heavy marijuana use from pretreatment to the 4-month assessment, and this reduction persisted until the 7-month assessment. The initial changes in those in the CBT condition from pretreatment to 4 months, however, did not persist through the 7-month assessment.

The California Clearinghouse notes that FFT aims to address risk and protective factors that impact the adaptive development of 11 to 18-year-old youth who have been referred for behavioral or emotional problems. The program is organized in multiple phases and focuses on developing a positive relationship between therapist/program and family, increasing motivation for change, identifying specific needs of the family, supporting individual skill-building of youth and family, and generalizing changes to a broader context. Based on the research and how the model fits with the needs of the state, FFT will prove to be.

effective in North Dakota in decreasing the number of out of home placements by decreasing the incidence of delinquent behaviors through improved family dynamics.

# Healthy Families America

The request for a waiver of the evaluation requirement for Healthy Families America is based on compelling evidence that:

1. reports of fewer acts of very serious abuse, minor physical aggression, and psychological aggression
2. fostering positive parenting, such as maternal responsivity and cognitive engagement
3. mothers were half as likely to be confirmed subjects for physical abuse or neglect
4. children of mothers in the home visiting group were less likely to receive a second report and had a longer period of time between initial and second reports.

The following summary of research highlights the compelling evidence:

# Study: DuMont, K., Mitchell-Herzfeld, S., Greene, R., Lee, E., Lowenfels, A., Rodriguez, M., & Dorabawila, V. (2008)

Healthy Families New York (HFNY) randomized trial: Effects on early child abuse and neglect. Child Abuse & Neglect, 32, 295-315. doi:10.1016/j.chiabu. 2007.07.007.

The study evaluated the effects of Healthy Families NY [now called Healthy Families America (HFA)] on parenting behaviors in the first 2 years of life. There was a trend toward lower levels of neglect at both times for Healthy Families NY program mothers, as well, although it did not reach significance. No group differences were found for substantiated CPS reports.

Outcome: Results indicated that at one-year follow-up, mothers in the Healthy Families NY program reported fewer acts of very serious abuse, minor physical aggression, and psychological aggression in the past year, as well as fewer acts of harsh parenting in the last week. At year 2, Healthy Families NY mothers reported significantly fewer acts of serious physical abuse.

# Study: Rodriguez, M. L., Dumont, K., Mitchell-Herzfeld, S. D., Walden, N. J., & Greene, R. (2010)

Effects of Healthy Families New York on the promotion of maternal parenting competencies and the prevention of harsh parenting. Child Abuse & Neglect, 34, 711-723. doi:10.1016/j.chiabu.2010.03.004.

This study utilized participants from DuMont et al. (2008). The study evaluated the effectiveness of the Healthy Families New York [now called Healthy Families America (HFA)] home visiting program in promoting parenting confidence and preventing maladaptive parenting behaviors in mothers at risk for child maltreatment.

Outcome: Results indicated that Healthy Families NY was effective in fostering positive parenting, such as maternal responsivity and cognitive engagement. With respect to negative parenting, Healthy Families NY mothers in the High Prevention Opportunity subgroup were less likely than their counterparts in the control group to use harsh parenting.

# Study: Lee, E., Kirkland, K., Miranda-Julian, C., & Greene, R. (2018)

Reducing maltreatment recurrence through home visitation: A promising intervention for child welfare involved families. Child Abuse & Neglect, 86, 55-66. doi:10.1016/j.chiabu.2018.09.004.

The study evaluated the effectiveness of Healthy Families New York, [now called Healthy Families America (HFA)] through a telephone survey. Participants were a group of mothers who had at least one substantiated CPS report who were randomly selected to assess early outcomes at their child's 1-year birthday. Participants were then randomly assigned to either HFA or a control group. Measures utilized include the Kempe Family Stress Inventory (KFSI), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Parent-Child Relationship Inventory (PCRI), the Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory (AAPI), and administrative information from the New York Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse and Neglect.

Outcome: Results found that by the child’s seventh birthday, mothers in the home-visited group were as half as likely as mothers in the control group to be confirmed subjects for physical abuse or neglect. The number of substantiated reports for mothers in the control group was twice as high as for those in the home-visited group. Group differences were only observed after the child's third birthday. Results indicate that home-visited mothers had fewer subsequent births that may have contributed to less parenting stress and improved life course development for mothers.

# Study in support of the Child Welfare Protocol: Easterbrooks, M. A., Kotake, C., & Fauth, R. (2019)

Recurrence of maltreatment after newborn home visiting: A randomized controlled trial. American

Journal of Public Health, 109(5), 729-735. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2019.304957.

The study investigated whether Healthy Families Massachusetts, [now called Healthy Families America (HFA)] reduced recurrence of child maltreatment in child protective (CPS) reports for primiparous (first-time) adolescent mothers. Participants were randomly assigned to either HFA or a control group. Measures utilized include administrative data from the Massachusetts CPS agency, the Department for Children and Families. The outcome variable was CPS reports available for 688 families, specifically, re-reports following an initial report (up to mean child age of 7 years). Of the studied families 33% had a child 3 months and older at the time of enrollment.

# Outcome

Results found of the 52% of families who experienced initial CPS reports, 53% experienced additional CPS reports. Children of mothers in the home visiting group were less likely to receive a second report and had a longer period between initial and second reports.

The largest group of children entering foster care in North Dakota are age 0-5 and HFA serves families with children in that age range. HFA is theoretically rooted in the belief that early, nurturing relationships are the foundation for life-long, healthy development. Building upon attachment, bio-ecological systems theories, and the tenets of trauma-informed care, interactions between direct service providers and families are relationship-based; designed to promote positive parent-child relationships and healthy attachment; services are strengths-based; family-centered; culturally sensitive; and reflective.

North Dakota plans to expand Healthy Families North Dakota as well as implement the child welfare protocol which will allow families with target children up to the age of 24 months to enroll as long as the site maintains documentation to show the initial referral was received from the child welfare system. North Dakota does not want to exclude families but rather expand by using the protocol to allow families entering the child welfare system with children up to 24 months to access the service. Families engaged in the child welfare system may not have previously known about the service and even if they enroll at a later age they may see greater benefits of reducing the recurrence of child welfare involvement, increase the length of time between initial and subsequent CPS reports and strengthen the parent-child relationship.

As noted above in Easterbrooks, M. A., Kotake, C., & Fauth, R. (2019.) Healthy Families America’s (HFA) best practice standard is to strive for serving at least 80% of families beginning prenatally or in the newborn period because doing so optimizes the ability to achieve greater maternal and child health outcomes, but there is flexibility so that this standard is not absolute [pg. 48, HFA Best Practice Standard 1-3.B regarding 80% first home visits occurring prenatally or within first three months, and pg. 6-7, HFA BPS Glossary, which indicates threshold for accreditation and demonstration of model fidelity requires adherence to 85% of all HFA Best Practice Standards].

Services delivered under the child welfare protocol are no different than the services delivered to other populations or target children in different age ranges. The only distinction under our protocol for child welfare involved families is the flexible intake window up to 24 months of age for referrals from child welfare. The HFA model has, since its inception in 1992, been working with child welfare referred families and has allowed flexibility with regard to age of child at intake in its manuals [pg. 63, HFA Best Practice Standard 3-1.B regarding families enrolled with open and active child welfare/CPS involvement].

These HFA target population characteristics were part of the original review, approval and well-supported rating provided by the Clearinghouse. Additionally, because the model was originally designed for families with children 0-5, model specific training covers this entire age span, meaning HFA’s 3 year minimum length of service ensures children enrolled up to 24 months are served by staff trained to work with families through the age of 5. The allowance up to 24 months is intentional to remain consistent with all existing model practices.

# Homebuilders

The evidence in favor of the use of Homebuilders in North Dakota to provide intensive, in-home counseling and support services for families who have a child (0-17 years old) at imminent risk of out-of-home placement or who is in placement and cannot be reunified without intensive in-home services. The request for a waiver of the evaluation requirement for Homebuilders is based on compelling evidence that 1) Homebuilders has shown to keep children in their own homes; 2) reunify children with their parents in a shorter amount of time, and 3) Homebuilders resulted in lower placement costs. The following summary of research highlights the compelling evidence:

Outcome: 73% of treatment group avoided hospitalization.

Study: Wood, S., Barton, K., & Schroeder, C. (1988). In-home treatment of abusive families: Cost and placement at one year. Psychotherapy, 25(3), 409-414. A comparison was made between families referred to the Families First home-based service program [now called Homebuilders®] and those receiving usual services. Group assignment was not random, but there was no significant difference between groups on financial aid, ethnicity, sex of referred children, or reason for referral. The groups were evaluated on cost of services and whether or not children remained at home.

Outcome: 74% treatment group remained at home and placement costs lower than comparison group.

Study to determine the effectiveness of IFPS (using the HOMEBUILDERS model) at preventing imminent out of home placement. The first study to assure accurate targeting of subjects by randomly assigning children after a foster placement decision had been approved by the court.

Outcome: 93% of the treatment group avoided placement.

The California Clearinghouse notes that Homebuilders uses behavioral assessments to determine outcome-based goals and help families identify strengths and problems associated with child safety and intervention maintenance of change. It aims to support families during crises using tailored intervention strategies and a diverse range of services, such as support with basic needs, service navigation, and psychotherapy. Providers use cognitive and behavioral practices to teach family members new skills and facilitate behavior change. Based on the research and how the model fits with the needs of the state, Homebuilders will prove to be effective in North Dakota in decreasing the number of out of home placements.

Multisystemic Therapy: The request for a waiver of the evaluation requirement for Multisystemic Therapy is based on compelling evidence that MST 1) it is more effective than regular services to reduce out of home placement and behavioral problems in youth 2) it reduces drug use, decreases days in out-of-home placement, and decreases recidivism 3) showed improved family cohesion, improved peer relations and decreased youth incarceration 4) showed improvements in the areas of home, school and community.

compared to “regular services” (RS) two years after intake to treatment to investigate whether MST was successful at preventing placement out of home, and to examine reductions in behavior problems in multi-informant assessments. Participants were randomly assigned to MST or RS treatment conditions. Measures utilized include the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Youth Self-Report (YSR), the Teacher’s Report Form (TRF), and the Self-Report Delinquency Scale (SRD).

# Outcome

Results indicate that MST was more effective than RS in reducing out-of-home placement and behavioral problems.

Mental Health Services Research, 1, 171-184. The effectiveness and transportability of Multisystemic Therapy (MST) were examined in a study that included 118 juvenile offenders meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Third Edition, Revised (DSM-III-R) criteria for substance abuse or dependence and their families. Participants were randomly assigned to receive MST versus usual community services. Outcome measures assessed drug use (as measured by the Personal Experience Inventory and urine drug screens), criminal activity (measured by the Self-Report Delinquency Scale as well as Department of Juvenile Justice arrest records), and days in out-of-home placement at post treatment and at a 6-month post-treatment follow-up. Also, treatment adherence (as measured by the MST Treatment Adherence Measure) was examined from multiple perspectives.

# Outcome

Results showed a reduction in drug use, decreased days in out-of-home placement, and decreased recidivism. Treatment adherence was linked with long-term outcomes, and analyses suggested that the modest results of MST were due, at least in part, to difficulty in transporting this complex treatment model from the direct control of its developers. Increased emphasis on quality assurance mechanisms to enhance treatment fidelity may help overcome barriers to transportability.

Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 60, 953-961. Multisystemic Therapy (MST) delivered through a community health center was compared to usual services delivered by the Department of Juvenile Justice in the treatment of 84 serious juvenile offenders and their families. Offenders were assigned randomly to treatment conditions. Pretreatment and posttreatment assessment batteries evaluated family relations (as measured by the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales), peer relations (as evaluated by the Missouri Peer Relations Inventory), behavioral symptomology and social competence (as measured by the Revised Behavior Problem Checklist), criminal offending based on self-reports, and arrest/incarceration records through 59 weeks post-referral.

# Outcome

In comparison with youth who received usual juvenile justice services (high rates of incarceration), youths who received MST showed improved family cohesion, improved peer relations, decreased recidivism (43%), and decreased incarceration (64%).

Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, 35(2), 227-236. Families were randomly assigned to Multisystemic Therapy (MST) or to treatment as usual (TAU). In their introduction, the authors note that this study is unusual in that it does not involve the original MST developers and was conducted in a more naturalistic setting than some previous trials. Youth functioning was measured using the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale (CAFAS), which focuses on school/work, home, community, behavior towards others, emotions, self-harming and risky behavior and thinking. Youth recidivism was also measured using family court records.

# Outcome

The MST group showed a significantly lower recidivism rate. Both groups showed functional improvements, with MST showing particular improvements in the areas of home, school and community. The California Evidence-Based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare notes that MST is designed to eliminate or significantly reduce the frequency and severity of the youth’s referral behavior(s) and to empower parents with the skills and resources needed to independently address the inevitable difficulties that arise.

in raising children and adolescents and empower youth to cope with family, peer, school, and neighborhood problems. Based on the research and how the model fits with the needs of the state, MST will prove to be effective in North Dakota in decreasing the number of out of home placements by decreasing the incidence of delinquent behaviors through improved parent-child interactions.

# Nurse Family Partnership

The request for a waiver of the evaluation requirement for Nurse Family Partnership is based on compelling evidence that 1) women visited by nurses were less likely to be perpetrators of child abuse and neglect, and had fewer arrests, convictions, and number of days jailed 2) fewer reports of child abuse and neglect, were observed to restrict and punish children less frequently, provided more appropriate play materials and had fewer emergency room visits 3) fewer child maltreatment reports involving mother as perpetrator and study child as victim. The following summary of research highlights the compelling evidence:

1. Sensory and developmental screening at 12 and 24 months only (control group);
2. Free transportation to regular prenatal and perinatal visits, and sensory and developmental screening at 12 and 24 months;
3. Nurse home visitation during pregnancy only, free transportation to regular prenatal and perinatal visits, and sensory and developmental screening at 12 and 24 months;
4. Nurse home visits until the child was 2 years old in addition to nurse home visitation during pregnancy, free transportation to regular prenatal and perinatal visits, and sensory and developmental screening at 12 and 24 months [now called Nurse Family Partnership (NFP)].

Measures included medical examinations and developmental testing using the Bayley and Cattell Scales at 6, 12, and 24 months, and home observation using the Caldwell and Bradley Procedure. The list of participants was also checked against verified cases of abuse and neglect and medical records were examined.

Outcome: Among women at highest risk, those visited by a nurse had fewer reports of child abuse and neglect, were observed to restrict and punish children less frequently, provided more appropriate play materials and had fewer emergency room visits. In the second year, all nurse-visited women, regardless of risk status, had fewer emergency room visits and fewer physician visits for accidents and poisoning.

Long-term effects of home visitation on maternal life course and child abuse and neglect. Fifteen-year follow-up of a randomized trial. Journal of the American Medical Association, 278(8), 637-643. Participants were determined at intake to have at least one risk factor: mother less than 19 years of age, single parent status, or low socioeconomic status. This study used the same sample as Olds, et al. (1986) and Olds, et al. (1994). Volunteers and women recruited due to a risk factor were randomly assigned to one of conditions described below:

1. Sensory and developmental screening at 12 and 24 months only (control group);
2. Free transportation to regular prenatal and perinatal visits, and sensory and developmental screening at 12 and 24 months;
3. Nurse home visitation during pregnancy only, free transportation to regular prenatal and perinatal visits, and sensory and developmental screening at 12 and 24 months;
4. Nurse home visits until the child was 2 years old in addition to nurse home visitation during pregnancy, free transportation to regular prenatal and perinatal visits, and sensory and developmental screening at 12 and 24 months [now called Nurse Family Partnership (NFP)].

Assessments at this follow-up included behavioral impairments due to drug or alcohol use, use of welfare, and reviews of Child Protective Services and New York State criminal justice records.

Outcome: Women visited by nurses were less likely to be perpetrators of child abuse and neglect, and had fewer arrests, convictions, and number of days jailed.

Status. This study used the same sample as Olds, et al. (1986, 1994, 1997, and 1998). Mothers were interviewed at 15 years, using a life history calendar designed to help them recall major life events.

# Outcome:

Families receiving nurse visitation during pregnancy and infancy had fewer child maltreatment reports involving mother as perpetrator and study child as victim. The treatment effect decreased as level of overall domestic violence increased. The authors conclude that the presence of domestic violence may limit the effectiveness of early visitation interventions.

The Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) program provides home visits by registered nurses to first-time, low-income mothers, beginning during pregnancy and continuing through the child’s second birthday. The program’s primary goals are: to improve pregnancy outcomes by promoting health-related behaviors, to improve child health, development and safety by promoting competent caregiving, to enhance parent life-course development by promoting pregnancy planning, educational achievement, and employment, to enhance families’ material support by providing links with needed health and social services and to promote supportive relationships among family and friends.

The largest group of children entering foster care in North Dakota is age 5 years and under. As Nurse Family Partnership focuses services primarily on pregnant women and families with children from birth to age 5, it fits well with North Dakota. The research supports the belief that this program will help the state to decrease the target population of children age 0-5 from entering foster care.

# Parent Child Interaction Therapy:

The request for a waiver of the evaluation requirement for Parent Child Interaction Therapy is based on compelling evidence that PCIT 1) Reductions in negative parent behavior 2) higher levels of praise and lower levels of criticism by parents in interactions with children 3) Children's compliance also increased in the observed interaction and their ECBI scores improved significantly. The following summary of research highlights the compelling evidence:

Study: Shuhman, E. M., Foote, R. C., Eyberg, S. M., Boggs, S., & Algina, J. (1998). Efficacy of Parent Child Interaction Therapy: Interim report of a randomized trial with short term maintenance. Journal of Clinical Child Psychology, 27(1), 34-45. Families with children referred for conduct disorder were randomly assigned either to receive Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) or to a wait-list control. Observations were made of parents and children interacting at baseline using the Dyadic Parent Child Interaction Coding System (DPICS-II). Parents also completed the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) for the child and the Parental Locus of Control Scale (PLOC), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Parenting Stress Inventory (PSI), and the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS), which measures quality of adjustment between marital pairs. The authors note that this sample of families had no significant levels of marital distress or depression at baseline and were recruited from a group that actively sought treatment for their children and so results might not generalize to other populations.

# Outcomes:

At follow-up, the intervention group showed higher levels of praise and lower levels of criticism in interactions with children than the control group. Children's compliance also increased in the observed interaction and their ECBI scores improved significantly. Parental stress scores and Locus of Control scores shifted to normal levels in the PCIT group, while those for the control group remained at clinical levels. Although comparisons could not be made with the control group at 4-month follow-up, all gains made by PCIT treatment families were maintained.

Parent-Child Interaction Therapy with physically abusive parents: Efficacy for reducing further abuse reports. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 72(3), 500-510. Parents and children were randomly assigned to a control group receiving standard services, a Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) intervention group, or to a PCIT enhanced group which also included extra services targeting parental depression, substance abuse, and family violence problems. Parents received the Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAP), the Child Neglect Index (CNI), the Abuse Dimensions Inventory (ADI), the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System (DPICS-II), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) Alcohol and Drug Modules and Antisocial Personality Disorder Module, which were modified to be administered as self-reports.

were completed by consultation with the child welfare workers or reviewing written material on cases. Parents reported on their children's behavior using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).

# Outcome:

Results showed that the PCIT alone group had significantly fewer re-reports of abuse over the follow-up period than did the control condition and also fewer reports than the enhanced PCIT condition, although this difference did not reach significance. Reductions in negative parent behavior, measured by the DPICS-II, were significant for both PCIT groups, compared to the control. Positive behaviors were high in all groups and did not differ.

Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 79(1), 84-95. This study uses the same sample as Chaffin, M. et al. (2009). Objectives were to test effectiveness in a field agency rather than in a laboratory setting, and to dismantle the SM Group vs. services as usual (SAU) orientation and Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) vs. SAU parenting component effects. Assessment information was drawn from three sources—self-report questionnaires administered via audio-assisted computerized self-interview (ACASI) using touch-screen computers, observational coding of parent-child interactions, and administrative data from the state child welfare database. Measures used included Readiness for Parenting Change Scale (REDI), Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAP), Dyadic Parent–Child Interaction Coding System (DPICS-II), Child and Parent-Directed Interaction (CDI and PDI), and P.R.I.D.E. skills. An imputation-based approach was used to estimate recidivism survival complicated by significant treatment related differences in timing and frequency of children returned home. Methodological considerations for analyzing child welfare event history data complicated by differential risk deprivation are also emphasized.

# Outcome:

Findings demonstrated that previous laboratory results can be replicated in a field implementation setting, and among parents with chronic and severe child welfare histories, supporting a synergistic SM+PCIT benefit.

Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is a dyadic behavioral intervention for children (ages 2 – 7 years) and their parents or caregivers that focuses on decreasing externalizing child behavior problems (e.g., defiance, aggression), increasing child social skills and cooperation, and improving the parent-child attachment relationship. It teaches parents traditional play-therapy skills to use as social reinforcers of positive child behavior and traditional behavior management skills to decrease negative child behavior. Based on the research and how the model fits with the needs of the state, PCIT will prove to be effective in North Dakota by reducing the incidence of child welfare recidivism and improved parent-child interactions.

# Parents As Teachers:

The request for a waiver of the evaluation requirement for Parents as Teachers is based on compelling evidence that 1) decreased likelihood of CPS substantiations 2) first substantiations of CPS also occurred later in the child’s life 3) greater acceptance of child behavior among moderate-income parents 4) greater tendency to read aloud or tell stories to the child among low-income parents. The following summary of research highlights the compelling evidence:

Topics in Early Childhood Special Education, 22(2), 67-81. https://doi.org/10.1177/02711214020220020101. This study investigated the effectiveness of the Parents as Teachers (PAT) program with low-income families. Families were recruited through community services and agreed to be randomly assigned to receive the PAT program or to a comparison group. Measures utilized include the Knowledge of Infant Development Inventory, the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale, the Child Maltreatment Precursor Scale, the Home Observation and Measurement of Environment (HOME) Inventory, the Developmental Profile II, and the Adaptive Social Behavior Inventory.

# Outcome:

Results indicate lower scores on parent knowledge, attitude toward parenting, and parenting behaviors were noted for lower-income families. Few measures were affected by participation in the PAT program. These included higher self-reported happiness when caring for the child, greater acceptance of child behavior (2nd year) among moderate-income parents, and a greater tendency to read aloud or tell.

Participants were socially high-risk families involved with child welfare services. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of voluntary participation in Parents as Teachers (PAT) for socially high-risk families on child maltreatment as identified by Child Protective Services (CPS). Measures utilized include three CPS-related outcomes were ascertained: 1) investigated reports of maltreatment, 2) substantiated reports of maltreatment, and 3) out-of-home placements.

# Outcome:

Results indicate in the unmatched sample, families who participated in home-visiting had significantly higher median risk scores. After matching families on measured confounders, the percentages of families with CPS investigations were similar between the two groups. However, there was a 22% decreased likelihood of CPS substantiations (hazard ratio [HR] 0.78, 95% confidence interval) for families receiving home visiting. First substantiations also occurred later in the child’s life among home-visited families. There was a trend toward decreased out-of-home placement.

Child Maltreatment, 23(3), 281-293. https://doi.org/10.1177/1077559517751671. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of participation in Parents as Teachers (PAT) in reducing recurrent maltreatment. Participants were randomized to either the PAT program or to usual care services from child protection. Measures utilized include the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Parenting Stress Index, the Family Support Scale, and official re-reports to child protective services (CPS) as a maltreatment measure.

# Outcome:

Results indicate no significant changes were found in maternal outcomes by group. Among nondepressed mothers or families without multiple CPS reports prior to study enrollment, PAT was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of CPS report recidivism.

Parents as Teachers is an early childhood parent education, family support and well-being, and school readiness home visiting model based on the premise that "all children will learn, grow, and develop to realize their full potential." The four goals of Parents as Teachers are: increase parent knowledge of early childhood development and improve parenting practices, provide early detection of developmental delays and health issues, prevent child abuse and neglect and increase children's school readiness and school success. As the program can focus services primarily on pregnant women and families with children from birth to age 3 or through kindergarten, it fits well with North Dakota and will help the state to decrease the target population of children aged 0-5 years from entering foster care.

# The Family Check Up:

The request for a waiver of the evaluation requirement for The Family Check Up is based on compelling evidence that 1) positive parenting practices increased 2) parent and child interactions improved and 3) children’s behavior problems decreased.

This study examined changes in early emotional and behavioral problems in children resulting from participation in the Family Check-Up (FCU) program. Families with toddlers were randomized either to FCU or to a nonintervention control group. Measures utilized include a demographics questionnaire and the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 1.5 to 5 (CBCL).

Outcomes: Results indicate children in the FCU group were more likely to move from the comorbid or internalizing group to the normative group by age 4. Few intervention effects were seen from age 2 to 3 years, while more pronounced intervention effects were found from age 3 to age 4. Limitations include possible rater bias and reliability of measurement tool to assess early internalizing problems.

This study used the same sample as Connell et al. (2008). This study examined changes in early emotional and behavioral problems in children resulting from participation in a family-centered intervention. Families with toddlers were randomized either to the Family Check-Up (FCU) or to a nonintervention control group. Measures utilized include a demographics questionnaire, a maternal indicator for depression, the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory, and the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 1.5-5 (CBCL).

Outcomes: Results indicate decreased behavior problems when compared with the control group. Intervention effects occurred predominantly among families reporting high levels of problem behavior at child age 2. Families in the FCU group improved on direct observation measures of caregiver’s positive behavior support at child ages 2 and 3; improvements in positive behavior support mediated improvements in children’s early problem behavior. Limitations include modest effect size and reliance on parental report of child behavior.

This study utilizes information from Dishion et al. (2008) to examine the longitudinal effects of the Family Check-Up (FCU) on parents’ positive behavior support and children school readiness competencies in early childhood. Measures utilized include parent involvement: Infant/Toddler Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Inventory, The Coder Impressions Inventory, a demographics questionnaire, a maternal indicator for depression, the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory, and the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 1.5-5 (CBCL).

Outcomes: Results indicate that parents in families randomly assigned to the FCU showed improvements in positive behavior support from child age 2 to 3, which in turn promoted children’s inhibitory control and language development from age 3 to 4, accounting for child gender, ethnicity, and parental education. Limitations include attrition and use of self-report measures.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a family-centered preventive intervention, the Family Check-Up (FCU), on improving parenting skills during kindergarten and first grade, when children are challenged to engage in a variety of new behaviors, such as sustained attention and self-regulation of behavior in the classroom.

# Outcomes

Results suggest that FCU effects on parenting skills were moderated by parenting contextual stress. As stress increased, so did positive effects of FCU on monitoring/family routines and negative parenting. No effects on positive parenting skills were observed. Results of this research suggest the effects of the FCU are more pronounced for high-stress families and contribute to the literature supporting adaptive, tailored approaches to intervention for high-risk children and their caregivers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

The Family Check-Up model is a brief, strengths-based intervention for families with children ages 2 through 17. The intervention aims to promote positive family management and addresses child and adolescent behavioral and emotional problems. The Family Check-Up is delivered by trained Qualified and Certified providers and the Everyday Parenting curriculum can be tailored to each individual family and their specific needs. The Family Check Up and Everyday Parenting will offer a ‘home visiting’ like setting and service for older children that is lacking in North Dakota. Families have complex needs and by providing Everyday Parenting and other follow up services are a key success factor to achieving the positive outcomes this model delivers. By increasing positive parenting skills and reducing child behavioral problems the program will prove to be effective in reducing child welfare involvement due to improving child and parent interactions.

# Contract Monitoring

Monthly and quarterly data analyses, and quarterly case-record reviews will be performed by the Contract Manager to oversee the providers performance and ensure quality service delivery to children and families. The providers are required, as part of their contracts, to maintain fidelity with evidence-based model standards and have dedicated staff to perform internal quality assurance checks. The requirements of the prevention plan and all aspects of the prevention plan management and ongoing risk assessment are being written into the providers contracts.

# SECTION 3: MONITORING CHILD SAFETY

The Title IV-E agency, ND Department of Human Services, has signed agreements with providers in the state that deliver the Title IV-E prevention services. Within the requirements of the Agreement providers must assess the safety and needs of the eligible child(ren) while providing the Title IV-E prevention service. The Title IV-E providers are responsible for the child’s prevention plan and will regularly assess the child’s safety. When there is a safety assessment/component built within the well-supported prevention service model the provider would assess child safety according to the model. If assessing child safety is not a component of the prevention service model the state requires the provider to assess the child’s safety using the developed North Dakota Title IV-E safety and risk tool. If at any time the provider believes the child is unsafe, they will follow the procedure to make a report of child abuse and neglect.

The child’s prevention plan is developed by the Title IV-E provider that is delivering the prevention service to the child and/or family. According to the requirements in the Provider Agreement, the provider must clearly state in the prevention plan that the child is at an increased risk of out of home placement, identify the needs of the child and family, include the prevention strategies and what prevention service is being provided. When a Title IV-E provider wants to submit an invoice for prevention services they must acknowledge in the portal that the child was not in foster care at the time of the prevention service, that the prevention strategies are listed in the child’s plan and that without these prevention strategies out of home placement is likely. The Title IV-E agency reviews will monitor the prevention plans through both the six-month reviews and the case review process.

Title IV-E eligibility is reviewed by the Title IV-E eligibility worker within the Children and Family Services eligibility unit. North Dakota has two Title IV-E eligibility staff that are assigned to review and determine the eligibility applications and all six-month eligibility reviews. In these reviews, information provided must identify if the child and/or family is experiencing specific behaviors, characteristics, or circumstances that are likely to have an adverse impact on a child's development or functioning and these such characteristics or circumstances place them at increased risk for maltreatment, involvement with the child welfare system, or out-of-home placement for foster care.

The six-month eligibility review is done when the child has an open prevention plan six months from the start of the prevention plan. Providers must submit the identified child’s Eligibility Review Form and information from the child’s plan to determine child’s continued eligibility if the child is still receiving Title IV-E prevention services from them. The Eligibility Review Form is submitted to the Title IV-E eligibility worker for approval or denial.

When the prevention service ends the provider will identify and document in the portal if the child remains at high risk and if so, follow up with the family is required. The follow up will either be done by the provider or NDDHS and action taken will be based upon the child’s risk as well as the status of family participation in prevention services as follows:

- When the child remains at high risk and the family did not complete the prevention service, attempts to re-engage the family and/or offer additional referrals for services will be completed.
- When the child remains at high risk and the family did complete the prevention service, additional referrals for services or resources will be made to the family.
- When a child remains at high risk and has a known open child welfare case, communication regarding the family’s completion of the service will be made to the child welfare staff.

If at any time if the provider or the Title IV-E agency believes the child is unsafe, they will follow the procedure to make a report of child abuse and neglect.

The Title IV-E agency will manage oversight of the providers and their cases through the case review process. The process is a review of eligibility determination, state and federal requirements, and payment. The review includes a random sample of cases active at any time within the six-month period under review. The state has set the schedule for the first period under review as January through June,

North Dakota Title IV-E Prevention Plan

these cases will be reviewed in September and the second period under review as July through December, these cases will be reviewed in February. The case review findings will be used to identify training needs, process clarification, payment/invoice issues, and portal management. If during the case review process a concern of safety or present danger is identified the reviewer will follow state protocol to report.

# Assessing Safety

The Title IV-E prevention services of Parents as Teachers, Healthy Families, and Nurse Family Partnership use both formal and informal risk assessment tools and processes throughout their involvement with a family. During each home visit, whether in-person or virtual, home visitors utilize informal assessment processes to assess and monitor for risks. This can include mental health concerns, home safety, child safety, intimate-partner violence, basic needs, among many others.

# Healthy Families will administer the following instruments:

- FROG Scale to identify risk and protective factors that could contribute to or mediate the risk for child maltreatment or other adverse childhood experiences. This is done during the first visit with all participants.
- PHQ-9/Edinburgh Depression Inventory as a standardized depression screening tool to be administered to the primary caregiver at least once within three months after birth, or within 3 months of enrollment if enrolled postnatally.
- CHEERS Check In (CCI) is an observation tool that measures parent-child interaction and promotes nurturing parent-child interaction, attachment, and bonding with all families based on observations made using CHEERS Check In a minimum of twice per year of the child’s life from birth-36 months.

# Nurse Family Partnership will administer the following instruments:

- PHQ-9/Edinburgh Depression Inventory including the suicide risk assessment as a standardized depression screening tool to be administered to the primary caregiver within two months of after birth, at six months and any time there is a need.
- STAR-Strengths and Risk Framework including the stages of change enrollment, 36 weeks, 1-8 postpartum, 12-month, 24 month and when major changes happen. Strengths and Risks (STAR) Framework is designed to help NFP nurses and supervisors systematically characterize levels of strength and risk exhibited by the mothers and families they serve.

# Parents as Teachers will administer the following instruments:

- ASQ-SE2 Ages& Stages Questionnaire Second addition includes child’s developmental progress, social emotional domains, and parent knowledge of early childhood development. Questionnaire is completed at six-month intervals.
- PHQ-9/Edinburgh Depression Inventory as a standardized depression screening tool to be administered to the primary caregiver at least once within three months after birth, or within 3 months of enrollment if enrolled postnatally.

The Title IV-E prevention services of Homebuilders, Parent Child Interaction Therapy, Family Check-Up, Functional Family Therapy, and Brief Strategic Family Therapy will utilize the developed North Dakota Title IV-E safety and risk tool.

Assessing safety and risk will be carried out by the provider of the prevention service with the intention of identifying safety concerns and minimizing risk. Providers consider multiple domains regarding the parent/caregiver and the child and documentation if action or intervention is required. The provider can complete the tool by either observation and/or informal and formal interview. The tool will be completed at initial assessment and every three months thereafter unless deemed necessary based on current risk factors. Training and guidance on how to complete the tool are provided by NDDHS.

# Multisystemic Therapy Instruments

Multisystemic Therapy will administer the following instruments:

- Initial Safety Assessment - completed at the beginning of treatment which details, removes, or locks up any weapons, sharps, medications, or other harmful items that pose a risk to the youth or family. Safety concerns are addressed at both administrative and clinical levels, through systemic conceptualization (FIT circles), expert support, safety tools: safety checklist and safety plan/contract.
- Safety assessments are completed by staff and parents ongoing throughout the course of treatment. The strengths and struggles assessment is completed by clinician and family at the start of treatment and updated throughout as needed. Additional tools that may be used in Multisystemic Therapy include:

# Child Welfare System in North Dakota

The core mission of the child welfare system in North Dakota is child safety. North Dakota is currently going through a social service redesign and working towards implementing a more comprehensive safety practice model. Decisions about safety will not be reactionary, but based on information observed, gathered and analyzed. The information determines if threats, protective capacities and child vulnerability exist.

DHS and the family’s child welfare worker from the human service zone will monitor and oversee the safety of children and their caregivers who are involved with the child welfare system and are receiving evidence-based prevention services under North Dakota’s Title IV-E Prevention Plan. Child welfare staff will be trained to conduct safety and risk assessments. Assessing safety and risk is an ongoing process continued throughout the family’s involvement with the child welfare system, starting with the initial contact and ending with a safe case closure. Assessments will be conducted by the child welfare worker that is most closely engaged with the family at any point in the case, acknowledging that assessments are more accurate when conducted by a worker who routinely engages with the family. If it is determined that the risk of foster care entry remains based on the assessments, the child’s prevention plan and eligibility for prevention services will be re-examined at a minimum of every six months.

The prevention plan as part of the child and caregiver’s case plan will be routinely examined to help monitor and track progress during the provision of prevention services. Parents and caregivers will have the opportunity to participate in the development and reexamination of the written plan. Children listed on the plan who are developmentally appropriate will have the opportunity to participate in the development of the plan to the degree that they can contribute. Updated safety and risk assessments may be used to inform the plan review.

A variety of tools and practices will be used to assess and monitor the safety of children who are involved with the child welfare system and receiving prevention services, including:

- Determining which families to refer for prevention services.
- Developing appropriate safety plans.
- Identifying the level of intensity needed for intervention with a family, including how frequently the family needs to be seen.
- Determining when it is appropriate to close an in-home services case.

# Present Danger Assessment and Present Danger Plan

When the family enters the child welfare system through child protective services (CPS) a Present Danger Assessment will be completed by the CPS worker to assess if any present danger exists or not. If present danger exists, a Present Danger Plan will be developed.

The CPS Assessment is used to identify possible threats to a child’s safety and guides the worker on what interventions are necessary to protect a child from dangerous family conditions. When an in-home services case is opened as a result of a CPS case, the CPS worker will complete the initial Safety Assessment and Safety Plan Determination prior to referring the case for in-home services. If the in-home services case is not the result of a CPS case, the in-home caseworker will complete the initial Safety Assessment.

Each family will receive a CPS Assessment and Safety Determination within 62 days of the case opening and will be completed or updated at minimum of every 90 days or sooner if there are new circumstances or new information that would affect risk. A final Safety Assessment is required prior to closure of an in-home services case. Resolution of any identified safety threats must be documented in the case record.

# Safety Plan

A safety plan is required when impending danger is identified. In every case where danger is identified, a written safety plan will exist identifying safety actions to be implemented to ensure child safety.

Safety and risk assessment results will be monitored alongside progress towards service goals by the responsible caseworker.

# Protective Capacity Family Assessment

The Protective Capacity Assessment (PCFA) is a collaborative process between the caseworker and the parent/caregiver to examine and understand the behaviors, conditions or circumstances that resulted in a child being unsafe.

The collaborative process identifies enhanced protective capacities that can be employed to promote and reinforce change, and diminished protective capacities that must change in order for the parent/caregiver to regain full responsibility for the safety of the child. The case plan is developed based on information gathered in this assessment.

# Case Plan

The Case Plan specifies what must change to reduce or eliminate safety threats and increase the parent or caregiver’s protective capacities to assure the child’s safety and well-being. The child and/or caregiver’s prevention plan will be a part of the case plan.

# Protective Capacity Progress Assessment

The Protective Capacity Progress Assessment (PCPA) measures progress toward achievement of goals in a case plan. It focuses on progress and change related to enhancing diminished caregiver protective capacities. The assessment also evaluates the status of impending danger and the effectiveness of safety plans. During this assessment, adjustments to a case plan are considered as well as caregiver participation and service provision effectiveness. With respect to safety management, it is during the assessment event that reunification is considered when the safety plan is out-of-home placement. The assessment occurs as an evaluation event at least every 90 days following the implementation of a case plan for out of home cases, at least every 30 days for in-home cases.

# Provider Responsibility

The approved provider is responsible for conducting a thorough and accurate assessment of the child and family to determine the most appropriate services. An assessment for safety and risk is also conducted on a regular basis. The approved provider must complete all tracking and reporting requirements as deemed necessary by the Department of Human Services for reimbursement. The approved provider will be required to also review the child’s prevention plan with the parents, caregivers, and child if developmentally appropriate and complete an eligibility determination for prevention services a minimum of every 6 months.

# Section 4: Consultation and Coordination

# Consultation

The North Dakota Department of Human Services (NDDHS) has consulted with other state agencies responsible for administering behavioral health (mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment) services, and with other public and private agencies with experience in providing child and family services.

NDDHS held nine monthly informational meetings in 2019 on the Family First Prevention Services Act (PL 115-123) to provide implementation updates to stakeholders and to give them an opportunity to ask questions and offer feedback. Meetings were held on-site at the State Capitol, and a conference call line was also available for those unable to attend in person. Information regarding these meetings can be found online at http://www.nd.gov/dhs/services/childfamily/family-first.html

NDDHS established the Title IV-E Prevention Services Planning Workgroup to oversee and guide overall implementation of provisions of the Title IV-E Prevention Services Plan. The committee consists of members from Children and Family Services, Division of Juvenile Services, Behavioral Health, Regional Human Service Centers, NDDHS fiscal and other key staff. Additional meetings and stakeholder phone calls provided additional consult with community organizations, tribal partners, private providers, and other state agencies. These efforts helped guide the services included in the North Dakota Title IV-E Prevention Plan and will continue to guide development of a continuum of mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services, and in-home parent skill-based programs.

Prior to finalizing and submitting the Title IV-E Prevention Services Plan for Federal review, NDDHS published a draft for public comment. NDDHS received a public comment specific to the omission of culturally responsive and inclusive prevention services to Native American children and their families. Currently the Clearinghouse does not include models that are culturally adapted to specifically meet cultural needs of various groups, however, there is potential for that to change as more models are reviewed and added to the list. As new models are added to the Clearinghouse, NDDHS will collaborate with tribal partners to evaluate if such models provide culturally appropriate services to Native American children. NDDHS recognizes access to a broader variety of models would be beneficial for our tribal partners to best meet their needs.

# Coordination

The NDDHS coordinates and collaborates with public and private providers to carry out Title IV-E prevention services as part of the continuum of child welfare services. Coordination and collaboration occur in a variety of capacities, from day-to-day conversations, planned meetings on a regular basis, etc. For example, as we developed the Children and Family Services 2015-2019 Plan, we invited numerous public/private partners to the table. These partners included: Regional Human Service Centers, private/non-profit agencies, human service zone agencies and tribal child welfare agencies, Division of Juvenile Services, State legislators, ND court representatives, Department of Public Instruction.

NDDHS continues a partnership with the Native American Training Institute (NATI) and tribal leadership through the Title IV-E Work Group established through the enhanced Title IV-E agreement signed in September 2019 and the State and Tribes Enhancing Partnership Strategies (STEPS) meetings. The STEPS meetings continue to be held quarterly with Tribal Child Welfare Directors, the Children and Family Services Director, Human Service Zone staff, ICWA representatives, Court Improvement Project staff and the Native American Technical Institute staff. The STEPS meetings included information and data sharing on caseworker visits, IV-E requirements, CFSP development and progress, ICWA compliance, and service array planning and development. The Title IV-E Work Group meetings utilize leadership staff from NDDHS and the Tribes to execute change in program access and deliverable services on a larger systemic platform with greater department division involvement (including Economic Assistance, Medicaid, Fiscal, Legal, etc.) The workgroup identified the need for enhanced communications and access to financial assistance for relative caregivers by expanding the eligibility criteria for TANF Kinship Care to allow children under the custody of a tribe access.

# SECTION 5: CHILD WELFARE WORKFORCE SUPPORT

North Dakota is a state-supervised, human service zone administered child welfare system. All parties are committed to supporting and strengthening the competencies of the child welfare workforce, ensuring that quality, effective, and efficient services are provided to children and families throughout the state.

North Dakota’s eligibility for foster care candidacy is determined when “a child may be at serious risk of entering foster care based on circumstances and characteristics of the family as a whole and/or circumstances and characteristics of the child or the parent/kinship caregiver’s ability to safely care for and nurture their child.” This allows our state to serve children both in the child welfare system and to prevent children and families from entering the child welfare system. NDDHS and contracted providers will monitor and oversee the safety of children who receive prevention services under North Dakota’s Title IV-E Prevention Services Plan.

The North Dakota Department of Human Services contracts with the University of North Dakota for the UND Children and Family Services Training Center. Established in 1984, the Training Center serves as the primary training agency for child welfare services in North Dakota including the Child Welfare Certification Training: a competency-based, trauma-informed curriculum. Training is designed to meet the child welfare initial training requirements for child welfare social workers in the state of North Dakota. Child welfare social workers are required to complete this training within their first year of employment in the State of North Dakota.

Beyond the core training, the Training Center works closely throughout the year with Children and Family Services Division staff members, child welfare supervisors, and frontline staff to support development of competency and skills of the workforce which are centered on the systems overall practice model. As addressed in Section 3, the child welfare caseworkers, supervisors, and regional representatives will be trained on the safety framework practice model which clearly outlines requirements for safety and risk assessments to occur both initially and ongoing through the life of the case.

Competencies of the workforce are assessed continually by the supervisors and measured through the case review process. Adjustments to current training or new training curricula are developed to address the needs of the workers. When new programs are implemented, state/zone administrators work closely with the Training Center to implement corresponding training. By using quality improvement strategies, adjustments are made when needed to enhance quality casework and focus caseworker time on critical case activities most important to help achieve positive outcomes for children and families.

Key to successful frontline staff is solid, competent supervision. It influences every aspect of the child welfare arena. Supervisors set the tone and expectations in the work environment; they ensure how policies are followed, and what practices are used. Effective supervision leads to better outcomes for children and families.

The Training Center, along with the Children and Family Services Division, has developed a comprehensive foundation training for supervisors. The Child Welfare Supervisor Foundation Training consists of four sessions: Administrative supervision; Educational supervision; Leadership and supervision; and Basics of clinical supervision. As the prevention programs come online, adjustments will be made to ensure supervisors are able to provide the best support to achieve positive outcomes for children and families including the development of appropriate child and family prevention plans and conducting risk assessments for children receiving prevention services.

These activities will enhance implementation of the Title IV-E Prevention Services Plan, by ensuring that the workforce is qualified and receive the ongoing support needed to provide for positive outcomes.

North Dakota Title IV-E Prevention Plan


# 51

As indicated above, the child welfare caseworkers, supervisors, and regional representatives will be trained on the safety framework practice model which clearly outlines requirements for safety and risk assessments to occur both initially and ongoing through the life of the case. Children and families not involved with the child welfare system, will receive services from a NDDHS approved provider. In order for a provider to become approved, the provider will be required to submit an application that includes program information, certification/accreditation and other supporting documentation that ensures the provider is qualified to provide the approved service as outlined in the selected Title IV-E prevention programs. The approved provider must follow minimum basic training requirement(s) per discipline of the evidenced-based program/service they will be providing and must have supporting documentation that their staff have competency in the recommended training areas through their degree or continuing education.

Children’s safety and protection from trauma is a priority and is vital to a child’s wellbeing. North Dakota understands that assessing safety and risk is an ongoing process throughout the entire time a child is receiving prevention services. Therefore, threats to safety will be evaluated during each contact with the child/family. These client contacts will be used to help monitor safety and ongoing assessment of risk. Regular and purposeful visiting with the child and family will enable the caseworker to assess how well the parents and other caregivers are meeting the children’s needs for safety and well-being, as well as the family’s progress towards case goal achievement.

NDDHS ensures qualification of each individual applying to become an approved Title IV-E provider by requiring documentation from the program model that verifies their certification and/or accreditation. The provider then agrees to follow the training and competency requirements set out by the prevention program. NDDHS trains the approved Title IV-E providers that oversee and monitor the prevention plans. The training includes but is not limited to the development and management of the prevention plan, assessing child safety, completing monthly outcomes, and determining eligibility every six months.

NDDHS will require a Provider Agreement with all providers approved under the Title IV-E Prevention Services Plan. This Provider Agreement will require the approved provider to train their employees and certify that their staff have received training and/or are qualified to conduct risk assessments to ensure ongoing child safety and the development of prevention plans to include goals/strategies to keep the child safely in the home and list the services being provided to ensure success of the goals/strategies. As part of the utilization review NDDHS may request employee training record to verify training. The provider will evaluate through the identified prevention plan whether the service is functioning as intended, addressing the needs that have been identified, and working toward the achievement of the prevention plan.

SECTION 6: CHILD WELFARE WORKFORCE TRAINING

# Child Welfare Title IV-E Training

North Dakota Department of Human Services (NDDHS) ensures that the child welfare workforce is well trained. The NDDHS trains the child welfare agencies on how to assist a parent/caregiver in applying for Title IV-E eligibility and what their responsibilities are when they have a child/family on their case load that is receiving a Title IV-E prevention service. When a family is involved in child welfare and receiving a Title IV-E prevention service, the prevention plan strategies are part of the family’s overall child welfare case plan. The provider of prevention services and the child welfare case manager collaborate to ensure goal achievement of both the prevention plan and case plan. The prevention service provider manages the prevention plan, while the child welfare case manager manages the overall case plan.

Training on how to assist parent/caregivers in applying use the portal will be provided to the child welfare workforce. This training will include the state’s definition of Title IV-E candidacy, the current approved Title IV-E evidence-based services available in North Dakota including the descriptions, target populations, and expected outcomes. Through the online application process, a caseworker can assist and refer the child for candidacy determination for a ND Title IV-E prevention services. Once determined a candidate, the child and parent/caregiver can access the approved Title IV-E prevention services and/or programs. The caseworker will assist the family in accessing the most appropriate evidence-based service based on the identified needs. Determination of the most appropriate service occurs through discussing with the family the service descriptions, target populations, and expected outcomes.

Caseworkers are trained on the Protective Capacity Progress Assessment (PCPA.) The training, and the expectation for caseworks will be to provide a systematic and periodic review/assessment of: the effectiveness of evidence based service provision, behavioral progress towards enhancing caregiver protective capacity, the quality of agency engagement with the family, and the re-assessment of child safety. Caseworkers will be trained in identifying indicators of behavioral change, as well as assessing and facilitating the readiness of caregiver change. Additionally, the child and family team will determine whether the service is functioning as it is intended, address the needs that have been identified and work toward the achievement of the prevention plan goals. The caseworker will maintain contact with the service provider to ensure the recipient is progressing as expected.

For cases that are outside the child welfare system served by an approved provider through the Provider Agreement, the provider will determine the identified prevention plan strategies on whether the service is functioning as it is intended, addressing the needs that have been identified and working toward the achievement of the prevention plan goals/strategies. This Provider Agreement is vital to ensure NDDHS oversight and will be used to ensure the collection and submission of outcomes to demonstrate that providers can meet positive outcomes for children and families.

# Child Welfare Practice Model Training

The North Dakota Department of Human Services contracts with the University of North Dakota for the UND Children and Family Services Training Center. Established in 1984, the Training Center serves as the primary training agency for child welfare services in North Dakota. Its goals are to:

- Design and provide training opportunities for child welfare practitioners and foster parents.
- Serve as a resource center for child welfare training activities.

Central to the Training Center’s work is the Child Welfare Certification Training: a competency-based, trauma-informed training curriculum. The Child Welfare Certification Training Program is a competency-based training curriculum developed to meet the child welfare initial training requirements for child welfare social workers in the state of North Dakota.

The training is delivered as a four-week curriculum (over 100 hours of training), one week per month, with sessions offered in both the spring and fall. During each of the training weeks, assignments and tests are completed by trainees that assess their level of knowledge and skill on several of the training topics.

North Dakota Title IV-E Prevention Plan Page 52

# North Dakota Title IV-E Prevention Plan

Successful completion of these tasks is required for certification. Child welfare case workers are required to complete this training within their first year of employment. During FFY 2018, 55 individuals completed Child Welfare Certification training in its entirety. Each week provides special emphases as follows:

- Week 1: Philosophical, ethical, and legal mandates of child welfare with a special emphasis on the assessment of child abuse and neglect.
- Week 2: Wraparound strength-based case management services (this week also fulfills the requirement for initial Wraparound Certification).
- Week 3: Knowledge and skills in working with the legal system, including understanding the role of the Indian Child Welfare Act and providing testimony in court.
- Week 4: Understanding and working with children and families in out-of-home care with emphases on attachment and separation issues, concurrent and permanency planning, visitation, reunification and providing support to the foster family.

A key component of child welfare certification training is engaging with families in a culturally sensitive and developmentally appropriate manner, around key decisions involving safety, stability, and well-being for the child. Family engagement is necessary to measure and achieve case progress. Practice standards guide caseworkers to involve family members in decision-making and ensure full disclosure is maintained with families throughout the process. Manualized support is provided through policy and procedure to the field as well.

Attendance is required at all sessions. Trainees are also required to complete all assignments in order to become certified. Regardless of the specific duties in their individual job descriptions, all child protection, in-home services, and foster care caseworkers are required to complete all four weeks. In addition to the child welfare workforce, case managers with Nexus-PATH Family Healing and the Adults Adopting Special Kids (AASK) program are required to complete all four weeks of training. Tribal child welfare personnel are invited and encouraged to attend.

At the completion of each week of training, participants evaluate their specific competencies and skills. They rate themselves on their understanding of the concepts or their skill acquisition. Feedback is also elicited from the training group on any additional training needs they identify. For example, if a participant does not understand a concept or skill, CFSTC staff will work with the individual and their supervisor to help them attain the skill. CFS Program Administrators work closely with CFSTC as trainers and evaluators of the training, suggesting modifications when necessary, particularly when laws and policies change.

Children and families in the child welfare system experience high rates of trauma and associated behavioral health problems. Unrecognized and untreated child traumatic stress can lead to the development of trauma-related symptoms. These symptoms can persist and worsen over time, making it critical to identify them early. It is important for the child welfare system to identify interventions that best meet the needs of those it serves and to adopt a trauma-informed approach. According to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), a trauma-informed approach is distinct from trauma-specific assessments and treatments. Rather, trauma-informed refers to creating an organizational culture or climate that realizes the widespread impact of trauma, recognizes the signs and symptoms of trauma in clients and staff, responds by integrating knowledge about trauma into policies and procedures, and seeks to actively resist re-traumatizing.

The North Dakota Department of Human Services has embraced the concepts of trauma-informed and is actively working to increase its workforce’s knowledge of the impact of trauma on those served as well as bolstering trauma treatment services. Trauma screening in child-service systems, such as child welfare, is one way to identify children and adolescents with trauma symptoms and improve access to evidence-based treatments. Trauma screening by frontline workers helps identify youth who need further assessment and possible intervention, inform service planning, create structure to discuss a child’s

North Dakota Title IV-E Prevention Plan

Welfare, and sustain trauma-informed systems. North Dakota has adopted the University of Minnesota’s Traumatic Stress Screen for Children and Adolescents (TSSCA). It is designed to provide clinicians, caseworkers, educators, and other staff with a tool for screening children, ages 5–18 years, that have or may have experienced a traumatic event and need services. Systems across North Dakota, including the child welfare system, are using the screening to identify those who may benefit from further assessment and treatment. In addition, there are over 100 clinicians statewide that are trained in trauma-specific and evidence-based treatments including Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Alternatives for Families Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and Child and Family Traumatic Stress Intervention. As Title IV-E prevention services are brought online, the Children and Family Services Division will work closely with the Training Center and other training entities to design and implement additional trauma-focused prevention practice model training.

In addition to child welfare certification training, North Dakota is implementing a safety framework practice model that will provide caseworkers and supervisors with initial and ongoing training and coaching sessions that will assist in the comprehensive assessment of the child and family’s needs. For example, one of the tools that will be implemented is the protective capacities family assessment (PCFA). The PCFA is a collaborative process between the caseworker and the parent/caregiver to examine and understand the behaviors, conditions or circumstances that resulted in a child being unsafe. This collaborative process identifies enhanced protective capacities that can be employed to promote and reinforce change, and diminished protective capacities that must change for the parent/caregiver to regain full responsibility for the safety of the child. The case plan is developed based on information gathered during this assessment. Once trained on the model, the caseworkers and supervisors will be provided ongoing consultation support by regional representatives and others with expertise in the model as they apply this practice to their cases. The support to the workforce will be ongoing.

Through implementing the new safety framework practice model, North Dakota has redesigned how training is delivered. In the past training was offered through distinct events. It is envisioned that the new training process will be ongoing at local and regional levels by coaching supervisors and caseworkers as they apply the new practice to their cases. This will involve the training calls to begin after the cohort has completed their initial week of training on the safety framework practice model and will be ongoing. The regional representatives will be key in organizing and facilitating this effort.

# SECTION 7: PREVENTION CASELOADS

The Title IV-E prevention case loads are managed by the providers and will be based on the requirements of the program model they are providing.

North Dakota has been incrementally absorbing social (human) service costs since the 1990s. Throughout the 2017-2019 biennium, the Department of Human Services, the North Dakota Association of Counties (NDACo) and human service zone leaders worked closely together with the support of the governor’s office and state lawmakers to review and begin to redesign social services to better serve North Dakotans and deliver more effective services in a more efficient way. As part of this redesign effort, the Department of Human Services adopted the Theory of Constraints (TOC) as its CQI process departmentwide. TOC has been, and will continue to be, applied to all child welfare programs so that holistic change can occur in each area of service.

An important system component analyzed during the Theory of Constraints work is caseload size. Manageable caseloads are vital to allowing caseworkers the ability to spend adequate time with children and families to complete critical case activities resulting in improved outcomes for them. The In-home services redesign team has recommended a caseload standard of 7-9 families for frontline In-home caseworkers. North Dakota will continue to monitor and oversee caseload standards through Theory of Constraints work and ongoing CQI practices.

# SECTION 9: CHILD AND FAMILY ELIGIBILITY FOR TITLE IV-E PREVENTION PROGRAMS

The North Dakota Department of Human Services (DHS) is in the process of developing a web-based portal. Through this portal, individuals or other referral sources such as private and public agencies, treatment providers, juvenile court, parents or caregivers will be able to submit the eligibility referral to determine foster care candidacy for Title IV-E prevention services. The goal of the portal in the final phase will be to connect and identify the most appropriate program(s) the child and/or family member(s) may be eligible for (ex., Title IV-E, 1915i, ND Substance Use Disorder Voucher, Free Through Recovery, etc.). DHS (the State Title IV-E agency) will review the eligibility referral information and give final approval of the foster care candidacy determination for the Title IV-E prevention services.

North Dakota’s definition of a candidate for foster care: A candidate for foster care is a child who is at risk of out of home placement and has an active case plan to maintain the child in the child’s home. A child may be at risk of entering foster care based on circumstances and characteristics of the family as a whole and/or circumstances and characteristics of the child or the parent/kinship caregiver’s ability to safely care for and nurture their child. See Appendix D for Eligibility Referral Form. Circumstances or characteristics for eligibility may include:

1. Under 18 years of age;
2. DSM Diagnosis for an emotional, behavioral, or mental health disorder;
1. Symptoms that are expected to last or have lasted one year or longer
2. Serious Emotional Disturbance that without supportive service or preventative care, out of home placement is likely
3. Significant interference or limitations of the child’s functioning in home, school or community;
4. Difficulty or difficulties interfering or limiting achievement or maintenance in one or more developmentally appropriate skill (social, behavioral, cognitive, communicative or adaptive);
5. Child whose adoption or guardianship arrangement is at risk of a disruption or dissolution that would result in a foster care placement;
6. Child in foster care is pregnant or parenting a child(ren);
7. Siblings in foster care;
8. Prior out of home placement (hospitalization, Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility, attendant care, relative placement, respite care, residential treatment, Qualified Residential Treatment Provider, detention, prior Department of Juvenile Services custody, assessment center);
9. Currently involved in two or more community services/agencies mental health, substance abuse, health, special education, juvenile justice or child welfare, respite care, alternative school programming;
10. Reunification has occurred;
11. Inadequate Supervision based on family and youth circumstances;
12. Parent/Custodian/Guardian/Kin Caregiver with limited parental capacity to meet educational, medical, safety, or basic needs of child(ren) due to:
1. Behavioral health concern
2. Incarceration of one parent
3. Inability to address serious needs of the child
4. Physical or intellectual disability
5. Debilitating or life-threatening medical needs
6. Homeless or substandard living conditions
7. Verbalization of no longer wanting their child
8. Substance Exposed Newborns

# Specific highlights of candidacy for foster care include:

1. Candidacy is eligibility criteria, not maintenance reimbursement;
2. States claim IV-E administrative reimbursement;
3. A child may not be considered a candidate for foster care solely because the ND Department of Human Services or its authorized agents are minimally involved with the child and his/her family;
4. In order for the child to be considered a candidate for foster care, the ND Department of Human Services or its authorized agents involvement with the child and family must be for the specific purpose of either satisfying the reasonable efforts requirement with regard to preventing removal from the home or if needing removing the child and placing him/her in out of home care. Section 471(a)(15)(B)(i);
5. Determinations for foster care candidacy in relation to the Title IV-E Prevention Plan will be made by DHS (the State Title IV-E agency.) DHS maintains valid agreements with the Division of Juvenile Services and four federally recognized Tribes pursuant to section 472(a)(2) of the Social Security Act. (45 CFR 205.100) allowing them to determine candidacy for Title IV-E administrative claims.
6. There are three acceptable forms of documentation that establish a child's candidacy for Title IV-E eligibility: a case plan, an eligibility form or evidence of a court proceeding. DHS will determine foster care candidacy for Title IV-E prevention services using an eligibility referral form and requiring all candidates must have a defined case plan with a service provider. The case plan shall specify the prevention services provided to the child and/or family, goals, tasks and an indication that absent effective preventative services the child is at risk of out of home placement. The case plan must be updated by the service provider and reviewed for candidacy eligibility every six months by the North Dakota Department of Human Services or designee.
