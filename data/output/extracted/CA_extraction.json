Although Title IV-E funding may be unavailable to support primary prevention, California will continue to develop and fund primary prevention strategies with the following objectives: Increasing access to supports such as childcare, food and housing; Reducing poverty and improving economic stability; Improving school readiness; Improving transportation; Increasing social connections within families and within the community; Reducing substance use; Improving access to healthcare; Improving neighborhood safety and play areas for children and youth; Increasing public awareness through engagement, education, and outreach; Improving maternal health; and Improving paternal engagement.",
        "Secondary Prevention: Prevention at the secondary level involves providing and evaluating direct services that develop and amplify protective factors and are provided to families objectively assessed to be at risk of child abuse or neglect. Secondary strategic objectives include: Improving accessibility to family resource centers that offer information and referral services to families needing support; Offering parent education programs in strategic locations; Providing home visiting programs to support and assist new and expecting parents; Providing respite care services for families that have children and youth with special needs; Improving access to family-centered substance use disorder (SUD) treatment services; Connecting families to public assistance programs, such as Medi-Cal, WIC, CalWORKs and CalFresh; Connecting families to Regional Centers for programs and services for children and youth with intellectual or developmental disabilities; and Parent education.",

Families living in poverty have more difficulties accessing the housing, behavioral health and health services, and other resources required to keep families stable and children and youth safely at home. California offers several safety nets programs that are intended to alleviate and disrupt poverty, including the CalWORKs (the state\u2019s Temporary Assistance to Needy Families welfare-to-work program), CalFresh (the state\u2019s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and a variety of housing and homelessness programs, including the Bringing Families Home program and the Black Child Legacy Campaign.",

        "Cross-System Coordination, Collaboration and Practice: The FFPSA provides an opportunity to enhance and support California\u2019s comprehensive System of Care for children, youth, and families across the state, which already includes all levels of prevention. An integrated system must develop a cross-collaborative network of support that meets the needs of families at every prevention level. Families\u2019 needs are diverse and cannot be addressed by any one profession or service system; those needs span public and private systems and agencies including child welfare, behavioral health, healthcare, public health, maternal and child health, education, housing and juvenile probation agencies, juvenile courts, the Child Abuse Prevention Council, First 5, childcare, and system partners. Only with programming that reaches across professions and service sectors, can California create comprehensive approaches to meeting these needs and promoting child and family well-being.",

This could include funding for traditional services, especially those used by Tribes, that meet cultural needs but may not yet be eligible for Title IV-E funding, and funding for the evaluations that may be required to meet the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse criteria to permit use of Title IV-E funding for supported and/or promising EBPs.",
