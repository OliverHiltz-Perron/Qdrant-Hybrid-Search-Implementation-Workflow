The Department appoints Program Leads responsible for oversight and quality assurance of contracted services, including fidelity monitoring and outcome data review. CQI processes include routine data collection, analysis, and collaborative improvement strategies with providers and model developers. Fidelity monitoring includes specific tools and protocols for each EBP, such as supervision checklists, adherence measures, and certification processes. Contract monitoring, data sharing, and collaborative CQI workgroups ensure ongoing accountability and quality assurance.",
      "quotes": [
        "CTDCF intends to utilize the CQI Implementation Team to support the development of fidelity and outcome measures for the CME (details regarding the CQI implementation team structure can be found in Section 6). While the specific fidelity and outcome measures of the CME would be developed within the CQI implementation team, at a minimum CTDCF will require that the CQI Implementation team operationalize the following elements into fidelity and outcome measures: 1. The development of quality child specific prevention plans; 2. The selection of appropriate services that align with the family’s needs; 3. Effective service referral and linkage processes and outcomes; 4. Appropriate monitoring, adjusting, and closing of child specific prevention plans based on the changing needs of families; and 5. Effective ongoing risk and safety monitoring.",
        "The Program Lead will meet regularly with the CME to review data based on the specific outcome and fidelity measures designed by the CQI Implementation team and embedded in the CME contract. If deficits are identified, the Program Lead will meet with the CME to collaboratively identify strategies to improve fidelity and outcome measures.",
        "CTDCF has developed a rich infrastructure for collaborative program design, implementation, data sharing and service delivery statewide. This infrastructure includes Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) between EBP model developers, other state agencies, the CT Judicial Branch, academic centers, and a network of community adolescent and family behavioral health providers serving every region of the state. CTDCF will leverage this infrastructure to build its Family First Implementation team as well as its CQI Workgroup.",
        "The Bureau of Strategic Planning: encompasses Quality Improvement (QI), Quality Assurance (QA), and Performance Management (PM): QI includes all efforts to provide strategies for improvement of the practice; QA provides ongoing review of CTDCF practice; PM includes the provision of performance data and oversight of the overarching performance goals and outcomes for the agency. The Bureau will be responsible for leading and coordinating the CQI strategy and providing the monitoring and management of the well-supported interventions.",
        "CTDCF Program Leads: Primarily responsible for the oversight and quality assurance regarding the specific contracted services and ensuring quality implementation and needed program improvement. Program Leads will work with EBP model developers to identify and develop reports on specific outcomes.",
        "Contracted Services: All contracted services in Connecticut have performance expectations and specific outcomes. The performance and outcome data collected are utilized to assess progress towards intended outcomes for Connecticut's families, and to assess whether services are achieving intended benefits. CTDCF Program Leads meet with provider agencies regularly to review data based on the specific outcome and model fidelity measures that are outlined in contracts. If deficits are identified in the performance expectations and outcomes, the Program Leads along with the model developers meet with agencies to collaboratively identify strategies to improve outcome measures. If continued challenges exist, programs could be placed on a Corrective Action Plan, up to and including termination if the deficiencies fail to be corrected.",
        "Training and TA: CTDCF has a longstanding practice of contracting with model developers for training and technical assistance to ensure model fidelity. CTDCF currently has contracts with all model developers for EBPs currently in place.",
        "Data collection: All EBP models and CTDCF require data systems that collect information on clients served. In addition, the EBP models require information on staff training and progress toward certification in the model. These data include staff participation in initial and booster training sessions, any necessary technical assistance, documentation of sessions (submission of recorded sessions); and track the content, frequency and duration of sessions. For each EBP fidelity reviews are conducted that analyze all the data collected. These reviews typically include CTDCF Program Leads, the EBP model developer, and providers. CTDCF conducts two levels of reviews: system reviews and individual provider reviews. System fidelity reviews look at these data in aggregate, while the fidelity review of the individual program looks at provider specific data. CTDCF, in partnership with the EBP model developer, will combine these data into dashboard reports and share with providers to inform discussion during fidelity review meetings that occur quarterly.",
        "FFT fidelity is assessed using various sources and from multiple perspectives from the family, supervisors, and therapists themselves. Clinical Services System (CSS) is FFT’s web-based system used to monitor program fidelity based on the fidelity and dissemination adherence scores.",
        "Therapist fidelity is measured in part through the Weekly Supervision Checklist and the Global Therapist Ratings. The checklist is completed for each week’s consultation and contains ratings for each case staffed for every therapist by supervisors after every staffing.",
        "MST has a rigorous fidelity monitoring infrastructure and includes measures for both the therapist and the supervisor. The Therapist Adherence Measure Revised (TAM-R) is a 28-item measure that evaluates a therapist’s adherence to the MST model as reported by the primary caregiver of the family. The TAM-R is administered monthly. The Supervisor Adherence Measure (SAM) is a 43-item measure that evaluates the MST Supervisor’s adherence to the MST model of supervision as reported by MST therapists (CEBC).",
        "BSFT therapists are assessed after each session using the BSFT Adherence Certification Checklist which is based upon ratings of filmed clinical sessions. This tool is designed to assess how adept a practitioner is at implementing BSFT and to provide feedback that can be used to increase clinical skills and fidelity to the model.",
        "PCIT providers will use a fidelity checklist for each session and will use specific parent handouts and the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI). CTDCF will require that PCIT providers ensure their room equipment is in good working order and PCIT providers participate in continuing education.",
        "The two NFP providers that CT OEC already contracts with have completed the key pre-implementation steps necessary to implement NFP to fidelity. All nurses and their supervisors participating in a 9-month comprehensive training program to learn how to conduct in-home visits and engaging in ongoing education and training occurs for both new nurse home visitors and supervisors. Supervisors receive ongoing consultation to monitor and support the nurse home visitors. NFP fidelity requires adherence to all 19 of the NFP Model Elements.",
        "The PAT National Center requires that affiliates provide annual data on their fidelity to the program model through an Affiliate Performance Report (CEBC). The PAT National Center monitors fidelity through the data collected within these annual reviews. Providers that meet at least 75% of PAT Quality Standards are recognized as exemplary “Blue Ribbon Affiliates”, recognizing that these providers are delivering high-quality services to children and families.",
        "HFA requires local HFA providers to follow the HFA Best Practice Standards and to demonstrate fidelity to the standards demonstrated through periodic accreditation site visits. The HFA Best Practice Standards are both a guide to model implementation and the fidelity tool used to measure adherence to model requirements. There are 153 standards that providers are rated on and ultimately help measure the current degree of fidelity to the model.",
        "Ongoing technical assistance, staff training, and periodic site visits are components of formal implementation support provided by the HFA National Office and serve as key elements of fidelity monitoring. For practice standards that providers are not in adherence with the HFA National Office provides CQI guidance and support to ensure fidelity and alignment with model.",
        "CTDCF intends to build upon the internal and external CQI strategies and frameworks as a starting place for its Family First CQI structure. Below are ongoing strategies Connecticut currently employs to ensure performance and outcome monitoring: Service Development Plan and Corrective Action Plan, Contracted Services performance expectations, Training and TA, Data collection and review.",
        "Because CTDCF is proposing to contract out many of the administrative elements necessary for the implementation of Family First in Connecticut, it is essential that it establishes clear and robust strategies for monitoring the CME. In order to provide adequate oversight of the CME, CTDCF proposes to 1) engage in intensive contract monitoring, 2) administer a well-developed and collaborative CQI infrastructure, and 3) develop a shared data system that facilitates both contract monitoring and CQI mechanisms but preserves family privacy.",
        "As with all contracted services, Connecticut will appoint a Program Lead to be responsible for oversight and quality assurance regarding the specific contractual obligations of the CME. At CTDCF, Program Leads are currently responsible for ensuring quality implementation and addressing needed program improvement."
