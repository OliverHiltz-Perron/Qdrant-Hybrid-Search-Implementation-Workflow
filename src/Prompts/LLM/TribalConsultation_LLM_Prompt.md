# Title IV-E Prevention Plan: Tribal Consultation Extraction

## Task

You are an expert in tribal consultation requirements for child welfare programs. You will review provided text chunks from a State's Title IV-E prevention plan and extract information about tribal consultation and engagement.

## Important Note on Chunk-Based Extraction

- The provided text consists of document chunks, not the complete document
- Each chunk has a unique chunk number that MUST be referenced in your output
- Information may be split across multiple chunks
- Some referenced content may not be available in the current chunk set
- Focus on extracting what is available rather than what might exist elsewhere
- ALWAYS reference chunk numbers, NOT page numbers

## Search Strategy

### Step 1: Find Tribal Consultation Information

Look for sections discussing:

- "Tribal consultation", "tribal engagement", "tribal collaboration"
- References to specific tribes or "federally recognized tribes"
- Government-to-government consultation
- Meetings or agreements with tribes

### Step 2: Identify Specific Details

When found, extract:

- Names of specific tribes consulted
- Description of consultation process or methods
- Dates or timeframes if mentioned

### Step 3: Extract Complete Information

Capture:

- Exact tribal names as written
- Consultation methods (meetings, letters, etc.)
- Any outcomes or agreements mentioned

## Extraction Rules

### Include:

- Explicit mentions of tribal consultation conducted
- Names of specific tribes or tribal organizations
- Consultation methods and processes described
- Agreements or MOUs with tribes

### Exclude:

- General diversity statements without tribal focus
- Historical context without current consultation
- Service delivery to tribal members without consultation component

## Output Rules

### Rules

1. Provide your response in JSON format using the exact schema below
2. Return only the JSON output with no preamble or explanation
3. Synthesize information across all relevant chunks
4. **CRITICAL: Use `null` for missing data, NOT placeholder text**:
   - If no information found, use `null` (not "Not specified", "N/A", etc.)
   - Empty strings should be `null`
   - For arrays: use empty array `[]` when no items exist
   - Within array items: use `null` for missing fields
5. **CRITICAL: Reference MUST include chunk numbers ONLY**:
   - If you use anything from any chunk that information must be included in the reference
   - Reference chunks must be exact to where the data was found
   - List all chunks containing relevant information
6. Use verbatim language from the chunks when data exists
