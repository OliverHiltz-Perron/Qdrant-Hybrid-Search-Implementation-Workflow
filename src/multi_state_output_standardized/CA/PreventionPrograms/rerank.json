When delivered as a stand-alone EBP, Motivational Interviewing shall be delivered by clinicians, social workers, and/or case managers. As examples, clinicians may implement MI as a substance use treatment service; social workers and case managers of FRCs and CBOs may deliver MI as a family engagement and case management strategy; or Title IV-E workers may use Motivational Interviewing to improve engagement with families during each encounter. # FUTURE PLANS TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL INTERVENTIONS\n\nThe CDSS engaged a myriad of stakeholders in determining the services to include in California\u2019s five-year prevention plan. Ultimately, the ten (10) EBPs chosen are all well-supported EBPs in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse and listed in Appendix A. For each of these EBPs, California is requesting a waiver of the evaluation requirement due to the compelling effectiveness of the practices and adherence to continuous quality improvement processes included in the design. Because not all services requested by stakeholders were able to be included in the current Prevention Plan, CDSS may support additional prevention services and programs for evaluation in the future, including those which are rated as \u201csupported\u201d or \u201cpromising\u201d but lack sufficient evidence to be rated in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse as \u201cwell supported\u201d. During an annual planning process, the CDSS will consult with opt-in agencies to identify additional programs and services that align with the statewide prevention strategy, have demonstrated outcomes with specified target populations, and have the potential to meet the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse criteria. The CDSS will also consult with Tribes to. 38 The CDSS is requesting a waiver for the evaluation of Motivational Interviewing both as a substance use disorder treatment intervention as well as a cross-cutting intervention.

The most frequent request from local Title IV-E Agencies, advocates, and service providers regarding EBPs is the selection of programs that are culturally appropriate and tailored to sub-populations whose overrepresentation in the child welfare system is a symptom of the mismatch between their cultural needs and the approach to service delivery \u2013 AI/AN and African American or Black families.",

Los Angeles, California\u2019s largest county as well as the nation\u2019s largest child welfare system, is currently implementing BSFT. Additionally, BSFT is one of the few EBPs that can be used with children 6-18, giving it an important role in ensuring coverage of mental health support within the prevention continuum for school-aged children and adolescents. A study on the efficacy of BSFT shows significantly greater improvement in parent\u2019s reports of adolescent conduct programs and delinquency and adolescent reports of marijuana use as well as emotional functioning of the family. Another study showed the use of BSFT significantly decreased parent\u2019s alcohol use. 50 Brief Strategic Family Therapy, https://brief-strategic-family-therapy.com/what-we-do/\n\n51 Santisteban, D., Perez-Vidal, A., Coatsworth, J., Kurtines, W., Schwartz, S., LaPerriere, A., & Szapocznik, J.

Several rural and smaller jurisdictions still struggle to garner the resources to deploy EBPs at scale. Many EBPs are currently being delivered through braided funding from a variety of sources, such as Medi-Cal, the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), CalWORKs, and local sources such as First 5. This section describes California\u2019s strategies for the initial selection of EBPs to launch the implementation of the Title IV-E Prevention Program established by the FFPSA. The CDSS reviewed several criteria to select EBPs for California\u2019s population the target population to include in the prevention state service array, including:\n\n- the extent to which the EBP was currently being implemented in California,\n- the qualifications of those who would be delivering the EBP,\n- the eligibility requirements of the EBP,\n- whether the EBP was effective at serving BIPOC children and families,\n- the amount of support provided by the purveyor of the EBP and\n- whether or not the EBP required an evaluation. The EBPs relevant to Title IV-E prevention services implementation that was developed in the AirTable created by Children Now.37 Reviewing this AirTable provided the CDSS with information about each EBP which assisted in selecting the ten EBPs listed in Appendix A.

Any of the Title IV-E funded prevention services included in Appendix A can be chosen by local IV-E agencies to fill a service gap in the continuum of services available in each jurisdiction or to reach a population where services are not yet available to meet the local demographic\u2019s unique and culturally diverse needs. These services can also be leveraged when other funds, such as those described below, have been applied but do not cover all activities within an EBP or when a recipient does not qualify for services through other funding sources. The Title IV-E prevention services funding is the \u201cpayer of last resort\u201d as required by FFPSA. The CDSS and DHCS will provide support through the dissemination of joint guidance on EBPs that include activities eligible under Medi-Cal once any necessary federal Medicaid approvals are obtained. Other payers for services may include individual insurance plans and CalWORKs or similar safety-net funding sources. The State will receive a 50 percent federal match for the delivery of these EBPs and will require that they be delivered with model fidelity by service providers as defined by the purveyor of the EBP. Upon federal approval, the evaluation process outlined in the federal law can be waived for EBPs in this Plan, all of which are Well-Supported EBPs according to the Title IV-E. Page 37\n\nPrevention Services Clearinghouse. California is thereby requesting a waiver of the evaluation of each EBP the state has chosen, as included in Appendix A. The cultural relevance of EBPs has been raised as a concern by stakeholders. To meet model fidelity standards, support is available for providers of EBPs from program developers who can assist with creative solutions to accommodate the needs of diverse populations. Accommodations can be made to the well-supported EBPs for cultural appropriateness with guidance from EBP providers to ensure model fidelity standards are maintained. California intends to use Motivational Interviewing (MI) as a cross-cutting case management intervention beyond its application to substance use disorder treatment and has requested the waiver for evaluation aspect. Motivational Interviewing has shown considerable success as an application to service interventions including in-home parenting skill-building, mental health treatment, and family engagement and interaction. Motivational Interviewing may be applied in a variety of settings such as community agency and clinical settings as a stand-alone EBP intervention or in parallel with other EBPs providing those EBPs are being delivered with model fidelity.",

This agency may be a community-based organization (CBO) family resource center (FRC), or Tribal Social Services. Page 15\n\nAgency contracted by the local Title IV-E agency to perform the services14. The local Title IV-E agency\u2019s role is peripheral, and its purpose is to be the authorizing entity for Title IV-E funded prevention services that determines eligibility and maintains responsibility for supervising the Title IV-E funded activities performed by the contracted community agency. Developing a community pathway is critical to an equity-centered approach to Title IV-E prevention as studies have demonstrated that \u201cracial disparities occur at various decision points in the child welfare continuum\u201d15. California\u2019s vision for prevention includes a community pathway for families to access services prior to a call being made to the child abuse hotline and for families to access services through community-based organizations when direct involvement with the local Title IV-E agency is unnecessary. Elevating the role of CBOs and FRCs as points of access for prevention services reinforces California\u2019s commitment to the vision of a true prevention continuum. # Cultural Adaptations of Evidence Based Practices (EBPs)\n\n\u201cEvidence-Based Practice\u201d is an approach to prevention or treatment that is backed by documented scientific evidence demonstrating positive outcomes in multiple research studies. Evidence can be obtained through a variety of methods such as randomized clinical trials, experimental studies, or meta-analyses16. The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) defines an EBP as an \u201cintervention which has been consistently shown in several research studies to assist consumers in achieving their desired goals of health and wellness\u201d17. Well-supported EBPs have met or exceeded a standard of sufficient evidence existing to make claims of positive outcomes for specified populations of consumers. Even well-supported EBPs may need to be modified in the future as they expand and evolve to serve the diverse cultural needs of California\u2019s families. These modifications will be planned for, encouraged, and resourced as part of FFPSA implementation. Guidance from the Administration for Children and Families, Information Memorandum 21-04, allows states to make eligible adaptations of approved programs reviewed in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse.",

NFP is a home-visiting program that is typically implemented by trained registered nurses. NFP serves young, first-time, low-income mothers beginning early in their pregnancy until the child turns two. The primary aims of NFP are to improve the health, relationships, and economic well-being of mothers and their children. Typically, nurses provide support related to individualized goal setting, preventative health practices, parenting skills, and educational and career planning. However, the content of the program can vary based on the needs and requests of the mother. NFP aims for 60 visits that last 60-75 minutes each in the home or a location of the mother\u2019s choosing. For the first month after enrollment, visits occur weekly.",

An integrated system must develop a cross-collaborative network of support that meets the needs of families at every prevention level. Families\u2019 needs are diverse and cannot be addressed by any one profession or service system; those needs span public and private systems and agencies including child welfare, behavioral health, healthcare, public health, maternal and child health, education, housing and juvenile probation agencies, juvenile courts, the Child Abuse Prevention Council, First 5, childcare, and system partners. Only with programming that reaches across professions and service sectors, can California create comprehensive approaches to meeting these needs and promoting child and family well-being.",

The PAT model includes four core components, which include personal home visits, supportive group connection events, child health and developmental screenings, and community resource networks. PAT is designed so that it can be delivered to diverse families with diverse needs, although PAT sites typically target families with specific risk factors.

Additionally, the Handbook of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy provides information on adaptations tailored to specific client populations, including American Indian/Alaskan Native families. Research indicates that Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is an effective intervention across genders and amongst different ethnic groups.\u2074\u2076 The Title IV-E Clearinghouse summary of findings indicates that PCIT is effective in improving the behavioral and emotional functioning of children, overall family functioning and parenting practices and is considered one of the most well supported and effective evidence-based practices in the field today. 46 Niec, Larissa, Springer Publication (2018) Handbook of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy: Innovations and Applications for Research and Practice.",

Depending on the current level of local ability to provide prevention programming, agencies are encouraged to begin the planning process with capacity assessments conducted locally. This information, as well as information gathered during the asset mapping and strengths and needs assessment process, will enable them to assess whether their current service array meets local identified needs, and how Title IV-E funded prevention services might fill any identified gaps. Asset mapping is a process whereby a community\u2019s assets are specifically identified, described, and often visualized geographically on a map. This process provides information about the strengths and resources of a community, can help uncover solutions, and assists with thinking. 37 Children Now AirTable, Prevention Services Inventory\n\nPage 36\nof how to build on current assets to address community needs and improve wellbeing. Similarly, a strength and needs assessment is a process by which information and data is gathered regarding the needs of a community. These assessment steps are conducted to determine specified needs and strengths which lead to the development of action steps. In this way, counties will be able to align Title IV-E funded EBP selection and implementation timelines based on the demonstrated needs of their jurisdiction as evidenced by the data collected from the asset map and strength and needs assessment. As local Title IV-E agencies begin their planning process, county child welfare agencies must engage local Tribes on the decision to opt in and the services for inclusion in the local Comprehensive Prevention Plan (CPP). Communication with representatives of local tribes must include the outcome and reasons for decisions made regarding the services in the local CPP. Local Title IV-E agencies must also partner with local Tribes when developing a CPP to outline how services to Indian families will be provided, and to ensure that the plan meets the unique needs of Indian children and families and ensures access to culturally appropriate services. During the assessment phase, local Title IV-E agencies are encouraged to map existing local funding sources to better understand how these funds can be leveraged and combined with other eligible funding sources. This could include funding for traditional services, especially those used by Tribes, that meet cultural needs but may not yet be eligible for Title IV-E funding, and funding for the evaluations that may be required to meet the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse criteria to permit use of Title IV-E funding for supported and/or promising EBPs.",
