Depending on the current level of local ability to provide prevention programming, agencies are encouraged to begin the planning process with capacity assessments conducted locally. This information, as well as information gathered during the asset mapping and strengths and needs assessment process, will enable them to assess whether their current service array meets local identified needs, and how Title IV-E funded prevention services might fill any identified gaps. Asset mapping is a process whereby a community\u2019s assets are specifically identified, described, and often visualized geographically on a map. This process provides information about the strengths and resources of a community, can help uncover solutions, and assists with thinking. 37 Children Now AirTable, Prevention Services Inventory\n\nPage 36\nof how to build on current assets to address community needs and improve wellbeing. Similarly, a strength and needs assessment is a process by which information and data is gathered regarding the needs of a community. These assessment steps are conducted to determine specified needs and strengths which lead to the development of action steps. In this way, counties will be able to align Title IV-E funded EBP selection and implementation timelines based on the demonstrated needs of their jurisdiction as evidenced by the data collected from the asset map and strength and needs assessment. As local Title IV-E agencies begin their planning process, county child welfare agencies must engage local Tribes on the decision to opt in and the services for inclusion in the local Comprehensive Prevention Plan (CPP). Communication with representatives of local tribes must include the outcome and reasons for decisions made regarding the services in the local CPP. Local Title IV-E agencies must also partner with local Tribes when developing a CPP to outline how services to Indian families will be provided, and to ensure that the plan meets the unique needs of Indian children and families and ensures access to culturally appropriate services. During the assessment phase, local Title IV-E agencies are encouraged to map existing local funding sources to better understand how these funds can be leveraged and combined with other eligible funding sources. This could include funding for traditional services, especially those used by Tribes, that meet cultural needs but may not yet be eligible for Title IV-E funding, and funding for the evaluations that may be required to meet the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse criteria to permit use of Title IV-E funding for supported and/or promising EBPs.",

Following consultation with counties, Tribes, and community-based organizations, as well as those with lived experience, California has determined that if a child falls within one of the categories specified below, the child can be considered for eligibility for Title IV-E prevention services. While the groups described below are at increased risk of foster care, a case-by-case, individualized assessment will be required to determine whether an individual child within that category meets the criteria of being at imminent risk of entering foster care. The following children are currently considered candidates for foster care under the existing Title IV-E foster care program and may be eligible for prevention services under Title IV-E based upon an individual assessment and determination that the child is at imminent risk of entering foster care but can remain safely in the home as long as allowable mental health, substance use, and/or in-home parent skill-based program services are provided.

Even well-supported EBPs may need to be modified in the future as they expand and evolve to serve the diverse cultural needs of California\u2019s families. These modifications will be planned for, encouraged, and resourced as part of FFPSA implementation.

An integrated system must develop a cross-collaborative network of support that meets the needs of families at every prevention level. Families\u2019 needs are diverse and cannot be addressed by any one profession or service system; those needs span public and private systems and agencies including child welfare, behavioral health, healthcare, public health, maternal and child health, education, housing and juvenile probation agencies, juvenile courts, the Child Abuse Prevention Council, First 5, childcare, and system partners. Only with programming that reaches across professions and service sectors, can California create comprehensive approaches to meeting these needs and promoting child and family well-being.",

These referrals can identify for families the local service provider that is contracted by the Title IV-E agency for prevention services who will complete an intake assessment of the family\u2019s strengths and needs. During the intake process, the contracted agency will complete an assessment of the circumstances of the child/family.

California recognizes that families are complex and dynamic, therefore assessments must view the family history in context with current circumstances to best understand their needs. For example, a family may have risk factors such as an historical mental health or substance use diagnosis, but the current circumstance of a hospitalization or substance use relapse may place the child or youth at imminent risk of removal and foster care placement. In these situations, when there is a recommendation that a prevention service may provide supports and interventions that mitigate such safety threats, a determination of candidacy can be made. Other examples of imminent circumstances may include but are not limited to:\n\n- Current or recent (within 6 months) family involvement with social services agency\n- Change in family relationships characterized by frequent conflict or violence;\n- Recent increase in substance use that impacts daily functioning and ability to care for the child or youth;\n- Recent incident in which a parent or guardian made a plausible threat to cause serious physical harm to a child or youth;\n- Incarceration of the caregiver;\n- Child or youth participated in criminal activity; and\n- Other recent or current circumstance that may cause family instability or a threat to the child/youth\u2019s safety or well-being. For a child or youth entering the Title IV-E prevention program through the Community Pathway, the initial assessment of the family can be completed by a locally contracted Community Based Organization, Family Resource Center or a local behavioral health agency.",

Page 29\n\nAlthough tools may be different, the case plan identifies the required assessment creating a standard across all probation departments and ensures that ongoing assessment is occurring. The CDSS will ensure through the development of guidance to Title IV-E agencies that regular, ongoing safety monitoring and periodic risk assessments are included in local policies and procedures. Periodic risk assessments will also ensure that the child and family are assessed at minimum to ensure services are appropriate through a 12-month period. Per existing guidance in All County Letter (ACL) 14-36, probation officer contact requirements include ongoing monitoring of physical and emotional condition as well as adherence to the case plan including documentation of the progress towards the established goals in the family\u2019s case plan. The Case Plan will determine the needs and frequency of ongoing safety and risk monitoring. During the 12-month period the probation officer is required to visit the child and family at a minimum of once per month where these activities will occur and complete new Case Plan every 6 months while the child remains a reasonable candidate for prevention services. Re-determination for candidacy shall be updated no less than every six months or as a new change occurs and will be done by completing both the \u201cEvaluation of Imminent Risk and Reasonable Candidacy\u201d document and new Case Plan. Probation Departments who opt into providing Title IV-E prevention services will use CWS-CARES for all case documentation, including candidacy determinations, ongoing safety and risk assessments, and fiscal reporting. This will ensure that prevention cases overseen by probation departments conform with the state\u2019s prevention plan and are aligned with all model fidelity and continuous monitoring processes as required. While prevention services data reporting will be collected through CWS-CARES, additional assessment tools beyond the FFPSA prevention services candidacy determination tool will be discussed and evaluated during the CWS-CARES Project\u2019s research and development work currently underway. # COMMUNITY PATHWAY\n\nCentral to California\u2019s vision for a robust prevention continuum is expanding the services and supports universally for all children, youth, and families.

For children and families receiving prevention services through the Title IV-E agency pathway, standard protocols for assessment such as the use of the Structured Decision Making (SDM) tools and monthly visits by the social worker will remain.

Several rural and smaller jurisdictions still struggle to garner the resources to deploy EBPs at scale. Many EBPs are currently being delivered through braided funding from a variety of sources, such as Medi-Cal, the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), CalWORKs, and local sources such as First 5. This section describes California\u2019s strategies for the initial selection of EBPs to launch the implementation of the Title IV-E Prevention Program established by the FFPSA. The CDSS reviewed several criteria to select EBPs for California\u2019s population the target population to include in the prevention state service array, including:\n\n- the extent to which the EBP was currently being implemented in California,\n- the qualifications of those who would be delivering the EBP,\n- the eligibility requirements of the EBP,\n- whether the EBP was effective at serving BIPOC children and families,\n- the amount of support provided by the purveyor of the EBP and\n- whether or not the EBP required an evaluation. The EBPs relevant to Title IV-E prevention services implementation that was developed in the AirTable created by Children Now.37 Reviewing this AirTable provided the CDSS with information about each EBP which assisted in selecting the ten EBPs listed in Appendix A.

For these counties there is potential crossover of the referral, assessment and service planning protocols between DR and the prevention pathways outlined in this plan. California\u2019s Community Pathway has commonalities to the DR Path 1 in that it aims to serve families outside of the CWS system, and commonalities with DR Path 2 in that the children and families served may be at a higher risk than the general public. In the community pathway these children and youth are determined to be at imminent risk of foster care. Because provision of Title IV-E prevention services is at the county\u2019s option, those counties who utilize DR will need to align their community and Title IV-E agency pathways with the paths they have created in their DR program to ensure that candidacy decisions are made by the Title IV-E agency and that reporting requirements and model fidelity are followed.",

Local Title IV-E agencies have also been encouraged to align their FFPS program with their System of Care (AB 2083) framework to include comprehensive prevention. For California, given the state\u2019s history with prevention, Title IV-E prevention services under Part I of FFPSA are a fundamental component of the broader comprehensive prevention planning for the State FFPS program. All County Information Notice (ACIN) I-73-21 and ACL 22-23 provides an overview describing the requirements of the State FFPS program, including the populations to be served, allowable services, and prevention services case requirements. # Asset Mapping and Needs Assessments for Selection of Prevention Strategies and EBPs\n\nLocal Title IV-E agencies opting into the FFPS program, and their partners must conduct asset mapping and a needs assessment to assist with the selection of prevention strategies and EBPs. The mapping should include a review of relevant demographics and other data or information that will help agencies to understand the service needs of the county or region. The CPP must include a description of the completed analysis and how the information was used to help agencies identify the candidate groups and/or other priority populations and prevention strategies that will be included in the CPP. The plan will also include the selected EBPs and the rationale for their inclusion based on this analysis. The rationale for selection must be included for each EBP. Local Title IV-E agencies must consult their local behavioral health agencies in the selection of the EBPs for the CPP. Page 43\nTitle IV-E agencies are strongly encouraged to utilize and leverage existing needs or self-assessment processes, and the information contained therein, such as the California \u2013 Child and Family Services Review County Self-Assessment as well as assessment information from partners, if desired and if such processes meet the requirements of the FFPS program. The plan must specify which primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention services will be included and how the populations disproportionately represented in the system will be prioritized for such services. # Comprehensive Prevention Plans (CPP)\n\nLocal Title IV-E agencies must submit a CPP outlining the agency\u2019s plan for primary, secondary and tertiary services and must include Title IV-E eligible service(s) pursuant to the FFPS Program outlined in WIC \u00a716585 through 16589.",

Risk Assessment is used after the safety assessment, in the closing of all referrals and in the opening or closing of child welfare cases. - SDM\u00ae Risk Reassessment: The SDM\u00ae Risk Reassessment is completed on all open cases in which all children remain in the home, or cases in which all children have been returned home and family maintenance services will be provided. This assessment provides the ability to see if the family has made significant progress towards the case plan goal and/or to assess the level of change to the original level of risk determined in the SDM Risk Assessment. # Probation Departments\n\nProbation departments use a variety of assessment tools in order to ensure ongoing monitoring of safety and risk. The Juvenile Assessment Intervention System (JAIS), Positive Achievement Change Tool (PACT), Youth Level of Service/Case Management Instrument (YLS/CMI), and the Risk Resiliency Check Up Tool (RRC) all include domains that assess for safety and risk. Currently in California, probation officers conduct assessments to determine traditional candidacy for foster care using the \u201cEvaluation of Imminent Risk and Reasonable Candidacy\u201d (EIRRC) tool. The EIRRC tool is a checklist that assists in accurately identifying why and how a child is considered a candidate. If the child is clearly identified as a candidate, then a Case Plan must be developed, and the following elements must be documented:\n\n- Description of circumstances: including but not limited to behavioral issues that place the child or youth at imminent risk of removal from the home absent the indicated services. This cannot be solely a list of problems but must include why these issues will result in out-of-home placement if services are not provided. This will include behavioral issues and obstacles related to the parents or guardian. - Types of services needed: for the child or youth to remain safely in his/her home. This must include any services aimed at the parents or guardians. - Statement regarding foster care: that absents the effectiveness of services, foster care is the planned arrangement for the child or youth and identify the type of planned placement setting. For those probation departments who do not opt into providing Title IV-E prevention services, they will continue to use this assessment tool to track traditional candidacy for juvenile justice youth.",
