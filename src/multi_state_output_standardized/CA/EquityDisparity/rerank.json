This also resulted in the creation of the Office of Equity (OOE) and the Office of Tribal Affairs (OTA) within the CDSS. # The OOE works to do the following:\n\n- Expand services for people with disabilities;\n- Provide services in multiple languages;\n- Review data to understand who is served, and how they are served;\n- Embed racial equity into policy and practice;\n- Enforce civil rights laws;\n- Support the work of tribal, immigrant, and refugee programs;\n- Contract with providers to increase services to underserved populations;\n- Diversify the CDSS workforce; and\n- Create an inclusive environment that engages and partners with community. The OOE will assist in elevating the work of the Child and Family Well-being Continuum by fostering increased collaboration across the CDSS, building capacity, and identifying priority operational and policy areas to improve access and outcomes. Improving access and opportunity and translating efforts into meaningful change will require teamwork, healthy dialogue, and commitment to learning. The OTA organizes and facilitates government-to-government consultation with tribal leaders and representatives and hosts quarterly Tribal Advisory Committee (TAC) meetings with social services related topics that include engagement and updates from Child and Family Services Division. The OTA also hosts and advises department programs and policy divisions on tribal engagement meetings on various policy and practice topics. The CDSS has placed a priority on tribal consultation and engagement in its efforts to increase accountability within the various parts of the department.",

This data (depicted in Appendix B) show that Black and AI/AN children and youth are disproportionately more likely to be involved in the child welfare system, to be the subject of child maltreatment allegations, and to be placed in foster care. Black and AI/AN children and youth disproportionately yield high abuse and neglect substantiation rates, as well as higher rates of entry and re-entry to foster care, while AI/AN and Asian/Pacific Islander children have a higher rate of short stays in foster care. Furthermore, poverty (economic inequity) and structural racism are contributing factors to these disproportionalities and disparities. While the following section focuses on systemic data regarding Black and AI/AN, many of the same inequities contribute to adverse outcomes for Latino families and families with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ+) children or youth. California fully intends to develop a Title IV-E Prevention Program whose service array contains evidence-based practices (EBPs) which have proven success with historically underserved racial and ethnic groups or can be adaptable to meet cultural needs when identified. In 2020, the CCWIP reported there were 60,045 children and youth aged 0-20 in California\u2019s Child Welfare system served by local Title IV-E Agencies. According to the 2019 CCWIP data, African American or Black children and youth make up 21.5 percent of the foster system but are only 5.6 percent of the general California population and are 2.8 times more likely to be reported as victims in child maltreatment allegations than white children. Also, per CCWIP in 2019, Hispanic or Latino children and youth entered foster care at a rate of 3.6 per 1,000 children, and American Indian children and youth at a rate of 8.6 per 1,000 children.",

California has taken, and will continue to take, steps to improve and increase relevant trainings, such as cultural humility and implicit bias trainings, within child welfare agencies to reduce racial biases. In 2010, the CDSS received a federal grant to create the California Partners for Permanency Project (CAPP). The CAPP\u2019s goal was to improve permanency outcomes for all children and reduce disparities in permanency outcomes for African American and American Indian children in or entering Long Term Foster Care (LTFC). The CAPP implemented a Child and Family Practice Model (a precursor to the Integrated Core Practice Model now being used) that included culturally appropriate engagement; empowerment of family, tribal, and community networks; and use of culturally appropriate healing practices and practice adaptations.\u00b9\u00b3\n\nThe CAPP promoted strategies such as (1) ensuring the system becomes aware of, and more sensitively interprets, the cultural values and traditions of families being served as strengths; and (2) ensuring access to, and supporting use of, well-being and healing practices that are relevant and meaningful to the family and its culture. While these strategies were important in improving responsiveness to culture and trauma, CAPP also found that California\u2019s child welfare systems needed to be changed. Through the CAPP work, the CDSS discovered that in order to provide some of the more culturally appropriate supports that are needed for families to heal, the child welfare system must first develop or adapt internal business processes and fiscal mechanisms to effectively host and integrate those supports and services. Another important lesson learned from the CAPP Project is the level of investment needed for a sufficient, stable, trained, and well-coached workforce that can effectively deliver evidence-based or evidence-informed practices with fidelity. Without fidelity to the model, the child and family outcomes promised are unlikely to manifest.",

An integrated system must develop a cross-collaborative network of support that meets the needs of families at every prevention level. Families\u2019 needs are diverse and cannot be addressed by any one profession or service system; those needs span public and private systems and agencies including child welfare, behavioral health, healthcare, public health, maternal and child health, education, housing and juvenile probation agencies, juvenile courts, the Child Abuse Prevention Council, First 5, childcare, and system partners. Only with programming that reaches across professions and service sectors, can California create comprehensive approaches to meeting these needs and promoting child and family well-being.",

Page 13\n\nCalifornia\u2019s prevention efforts will be coordinated in consultation and collaboration with Tribes to ensure the provision of culturally appropriate prevention services in a manner consistent with active efforts to support Indian families in both rural and urban settings. Historically, rural local Title IV-E agencies have fewer local funding resources to draw upon, and struggle to meet the needs of their Tribal families. While Tribes have established culturally appropriate services to meet their members\u2019 needs, limited funding has typically been available through child welfare agencies. The availability of Title IV-E prevention services will help to address these resource deficits. # Address the Systemic Disparities Black Families Face in Child Welfare Programs\n\nThe significant histories of systemic racism in society and in government actions have also had lasting impacts within California\u2019s child welfare programs on Black children and families.",

The CDSS plans to engage external experts as well as local Title IV-E Agencies, Tribes, and program developers to develop standardized, statewide approaches to fidelity monitoring and CQI for each specific EBP which is part of the Title IV-E Prevention Plan. This statewide approach will draw upon any available technical assistance and training from each EBPs program developer. Each EBP has \u201cessential requirements\u201d and \u201cquality standards\u201d to which providers must adhere to in order to implement the EBP with fidelity to the practice model. These requirements and standards typically include training and supervision requirements, as well as specific commitments to various model requirements. Some EBPs include case review, consultation, specified assessment tools and protocols, as well as technical assistance activities as additional tools that work to ensure interventions are being delivered with fidelity to the practice model. It is anticipated that local service provider contracts will be developed or amended to include fidelity monitoring and CQI processes and requirements in accordance with state-issued guidance to ensure standardized practice for each EBP being implemented at various localities throughout the State. The CDSS will hire a contractor to assist in the development of a proposal for model fidelity oversight of EBP\u2019s across implementation sites. With guidance from the contractor, the program\u2019s governance structure, and the State Prevention Advisory Committee, the CDSS will describe the process by which model fidelity of the programs will be overseen within each individual provider contract. Additionally, data will be collected from each provider either through the model fidelity oversight process developed within the CDSS contract and to the extent that CWS-CARES can collect the information or if there are additional ways to leverage other data systems through CWS-CARES to collect the data. Essentially the data will either come directly from the providers or from CWS-CARES. The CDSS will conduct periodic\n\nPage 39\n\nreviews to assess and monitor fidelity of each EBP across local agencies and work with the purveyor to provide resources for improvements and course corrections.

To improve consultation efforts with Tribes, the CDSS instituted the Tribal Consultation Policy (TCP) in 2017 to guide consultations between the CDSS and the 109 federally recognized Tribes in California on policies and procedures that affect Tribes. The Five-Year State Prevention Plan\u2019s review adhered to the 2017 TCP. These recent changes within the CDSS have supported the State\u2019s efforts to build on prior work engaging communities and increasing partnerships with BIPOC, Tribes, and immigrant communities, as well as supporting the additional work that is necessary to strengthen equity within CDSS programs. These structures will also support the equity efforts for implementation of Title IV-E prevention services under FFPSA. Page 12\n\n# Cultivate and Maintain Meaningful Relationships with Tribes\n\nWith 109 federally recognized Tribes in California and 78 entities petitioning to be recognized, within California is the United States\u2019 largest AI/AN population. The United States and California\u2019s history of actions, laws and policies discriminating against American Indian/Alaska native\u2019s and denying the existence of tribal sovereignty has long lasting impacts causing trauma today. The detrimental impact of these actions on tribal children and families is evident in the overrepresentation of American Indian and Alaska native children in the child welfare system and in foster care. California recognizes the significant work that must be done to address the impacts of systemic and historical trauma and is committed to working with Tribes to address these impacts and create healing opportunities. The CDSS is especially committed to improving the outcomes of AI/AN children, youth, and families. The CDSS has Title IV-E Agreements with the Yurok and Karuk Tribes that support partnering in government-to-government relationships aiming to support Tribes\u2019 control over programs and services that assist AI/AN children and families. Over the last several years, the CDSS has ramped up efforts to improve relationships with Tribes by ensuring that the needs of AI/AN families are consistently at the forefront of policy development.

When delivered as a stand-alone EBP, Motivational Interviewing shall be delivered by clinicians, social workers, and/or case managers. As examples, clinicians may implement MI as a substance use treatment service; social workers and case managers of FRCs and CBOs may deliver MI as a family engagement and case management strategy; or Title IV-E workers may use Motivational Interviewing to improve engagement with families during each encounter. # FUTURE PLANS TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL INTERVENTIONS\n\nThe CDSS engaged a myriad of stakeholders in determining the services to include in California\u2019s five-year prevention plan. Ultimately, the ten (10) EBPs chosen are all well-supported EBPs in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse and listed in Appendix A. For each of these EBPs, California is requesting a waiver of the evaluation requirement due to the compelling effectiveness of the practices and adherence to continuous quality improvement processes included in the design. Because not all services requested by stakeholders were able to be included in the current Prevention Plan, CDSS may support additional prevention services and programs for evaluation in the future, including those which are rated as \u201csupported\u201d or \u201cpromising\u201d but lack sufficient evidence to be rated in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse as \u201cwell supported\u201d. During an annual planning process, the CDSS will consult with opt-in agencies to identify additional programs and services that align with the statewide prevention strategy, have demonstrated outcomes with specified target populations, and have the potential to meet the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse criteria. The CDSS will also consult with Tribes to. 38 The CDSS is requesting a waiver for the evaluation of Motivational Interviewing both as a substance use disorder treatment intervention as well as a cross-cutting intervention.

The most frequent request from local Title IV-E Agencies, advocates, and service providers regarding EBPs is the selection of programs that are culturally appropriate and tailored to sub-populations whose overrepresentation in the child welfare system is a symptom of the mismatch between their cultural needs and the approach to service delivery \u2013 AI/AN and African American or Black families.",

Since the spring of 2019, the CDSS convened multiple stakeholder workgroups, including a widely attended Prevention Summit, designed to orient stakeholders, and gauge their needs and readiness to implement prevention services. The CDSS sought feedback through a detailed survey process, as well as through focused conversations with Child Welfare Directors, Chief Probation Officers, youth and parents with lived experience, service providers, and training academies. The CDSS will continue to reach out to varied partners and stakeholders as the Title IV-E Prevention Program is implemented. In addition, the CDSS has committed to an annual planning update process in collaboration with counties and stakeholders, and in consultation with Tribes. At that time, program enhancements such as adding EBPs or modifying candidacy populations may be considered. Page 20\n\n# Tribal Consultation\n\nThroughout the development of the prevention plan, the CDSS regularly engaged Tribes by requesting and engaging in formal government to government Tribal Consultations and through engagement of the Tribal Advisory Committee to solicit input on the development of the Title IV-E Prevention Program. The Tribal Advisory Committee convened in the fall/winter of 2021, where CDSS presented feedback on the state plan to respond to the Children\u2019s Bureau feedback and assisted drafting the most recent version of the Plan. # CHILD AND FAMILY ELIGIBILITY\n\n# CANDIDATES FOR FOSTER CARE\n\nThe FFPSA defines a candidate for foster care as a child who is identified in a prevention plan as being at imminent risk of entering foster care, but who can remain safely in the child\u2019s home or in a kinship placement if eligible prevention services that are necessary to prevent the entry of the child into foster care are provided. The CDSS has analyzed historical data from 2016-2019 and collaborated with various stakeholders to identify methods for determining which children and families are eligible for referral for Title IV-E prevention services under FFPSA. California recognizes that while categories of children and families eligible for prevention services can be identified and referred, actual \u201cimminent risk\u201d of foster care entry and candidacy can only be determined on a case-by-case basis, with thoughtful consideration for each child and change family\u2019s unique needs and circumstances, and with use of an unbiased process and/or tools to assess risk.",
