When delivered as a stand-alone EBP, Motivational Interviewing shall be delivered by clinicians, social workers, and/or case managers. As examples, clinicians may implement MI as a substance use treatment service; social workers and case managers of FRCs and CBOs may deliver MI as a family engagement and case management strategy; or Title IV-E workers may use Motivational Interviewing to improve engagement with families during each encounter. # FUTURE PLANS TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL INTERVENTIONS\n\nThe CDSS engaged a myriad of stakeholders in determining the services to include in California\u2019s five-year prevention plan. Ultimately, the ten (10) EBPs chosen are all well-supported EBPs in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse and listed in Appendix A. For each of these EBPs, California is requesting a waiver of the evaluation requirement due to the compelling effectiveness of the practices and adherence to continuous quality improvement processes included in the design. Because not all services requested by stakeholders were able to be included in the current Prevention Plan, CDSS may support additional prevention services and programs for evaluation in the future, including those which are rated as \u201csupported\u201d or \u201cpromising\u201d but lack sufficient evidence to be rated in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse as \u201cwell supported\u201d. During an annual planning process, the CDSS will consult with opt-in agencies to identify additional programs and services that align with the statewide prevention strategy, have demonstrated outcomes with specified target populations, and have the potential to meet the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse criteria. The CDSS will also consult with Tribes to. 38 The CDSS is requesting a waiver for the evaluation of Motivational Interviewing both as a substance use disorder treatment intervention as well as a cross-cutting intervention.

The most frequent request from local Title IV-E Agencies, advocates, and service providers regarding EBPs is the selection of programs that are culturally appropriate and tailored to sub-populations whose overrepresentation in the child welfare system is a symptom of the mismatch between their cultural needs and the approach to service delivery \u2013 AI/AN and African American or Black families.",

When a family provides information that there is a \u2018reason to believe\u2019 a child is an Indian child36 during an initial intake assessment by local service provider, further inquiry is necessary and must be done by contacting the Tribe consistent with Welfare and Institutions Code (WIC) Section 224.2(e). When a family provides information during an initial intake assessment by local service provider that there is a \u2018reason to know\u2019 a child is an Indian child, as described in WIC Section 224.2(d) the information must be shared with the Tribe so that the Tribe has an opportunity to participate in the family assessment, case planning, service delivery, and any safety and risk assessments. Local Title IV-E agencies must also partner with Tribes to ensure that culturally appropriate services are available at the local level to meet the needs of Indian children and families who are served through the community pathway. # CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE PROGRAMMING\n\nThe CDSS recognizes the need to identify culturally appropriate services for evaluation and inclusion both in the state\u2019s prevention plan and the Title IV-E Prevention Clearinghouse before they can be implemented locally and eligible for Title IV-E reimbursement. The CDSS will encourage and support local Title IV-E agencies to implement available cultural adaptations to services that meet the cultural needs of diverse groups, particularly those disproportionately represented in the child welfare system including tribal families. In addition, jurisdictions participating in the state\u2019s Family First Prevention Services Program will be able to supplement Title IV-E prevention services with culturally appropriate programs not yet eligible for Title IV-E reimbursement using additional funds that are provided to those counties who opt in. Funding from other sources supporting prevention activities can be leveraged to accomplish these goals, including use of state funds through the Family First Prevention Program state block grant. These funds can also be used to contract directly with Tribes to build service capacity and/or provide services to their members. # CALIFORNIA TRIBES WITH A TITLE IV-E AGREEMENT WITH CDSS\n\nTribes that have a Title IV-E agreement with the State pursuant to WIC Sections 10553.1 and WIC Sections 16000.6 to operate, independent of counties, a Title IV-E program may opt to directly provide Title IV-E prevention services.",

The CDSS is working collaboratively with DHCS to strengthen health preventative programs and systems of care by improving pathways for access to services, which is a fundamental goal of the FFPSA. # Coordination with Title IV-B Services\n\nCalifornia will ensure that the Title IV-E Prevention Program and Title IV-B California Family Services Plan (CFSP) goals align. The California Title IV-E Prevention Program will function alongside other prevention programs and funds, such as Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) funding, FRCs, and contracts with, or grants to, CBOs, all acting in concert in order to move the gravitational center of child and family serving systems upstream. Within this framework, local Title IV-E Agencies can provide a complete and comprehensive array of services to meet the needs of children and families across the entire continuum of care. Prevention services provided for children and parents, or caregivers will be coordinated with services provided under Subparts 1 and 2 of Title IV-B of the Social Security Act. Title IV-B, Subpart 1 funds are primarily used for child welfare caseworker services. In this capacity, these funds support essential caseworker activities with children and families. Title IV-B, Subpart 2 funds support case worker visits, kinship navigator programs, and family services and supports under the PSSF program. The CDSS will inform and educate the local Title IV-E Agencies on how the services within these programs may overlap. Local Title IV-E agencies are required to complete an assessment to determine how to best spend their PSSF funds. During this process the CDSS will encourage the local Title IV-E agencies to select a mix of programs in their CPP including those which are not funded by Title IV-E. The CDSS is committed to programs and processes that complement each other and serve the overall purpose of creating a robust service array that creates and supports a full system of care for children, youth, and families.",

With the expiration of the Title IV-E waivers, FFPSA\u2019s authorization to use Title IV-E funds for prevention services stands to positively impact ongoing efforts to build a robust prevention continuum. Using Title IV-E funds will allow for service delivery to traditionally underserved populations and expand evidence-based practices to prevent child harm, especially the harm caused by trauma associated with detention and foster care. Below are the strategies California currently employs at each level of prevention, with those most impacted by FFPSA. # Primary Prevention\n\nPrevention at the primary level addresses general population needs and child well-being through a social determinants of health approach. Although Title IV-E funding may be unavailable to support primary prevention, California will continue to develop and fund primary prevention strategies with the following objectives:\n\n- Increasing access to supports such as childcare, food and housing;\n- Reducing poverty and improving economic stability;\n- Improving school readiness;\n- Improving transportation;\n- Increasing social connections within families and within the community;\n- Reducing substance use;\n- Improving access to healthcare;\n- Improving neighborhood safety and play areas for children and youth;\n- Increasing public awareness through engagement, education, and outreach;\n- Improving maternal health; and\n- Improving paternal engagement. For child welfare or probation agencies (hereinafter \u201clocal Title IV-E agencies\u201d) and Tribes with a Title IV-E agreement with the State who opt-in, Title IV-E prevention funding can enhance secondary and tertiary prevention services. # Secondary Prevention\n\nPrevention at the secondary level involves providing and evaluating direct services that develop and amplify protective factors and are provided to families objectively assessed to be at risk of child abuse or neglect.",

Several rural and smaller jurisdictions still struggle to garner the resources to deploy EBPs at scale. Many EBPs are currently being delivered through braided funding from a variety of sources, such as Medi-Cal, the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), CalWORKs, and local sources such as First 5. This section describes California\u2019s strategies for the initial selection of EBPs to launch the implementation of the Title IV-E Prevention Program established by the FFPSA. The CDSS reviewed several criteria to select EBPs for California\u2019s population the target population to include in the prevention state service array, including:\n\n- the extent to which the EBP was currently being implemented in California,\n- the qualifications of those who would be delivering the EBP,\n- the eligibility requirements of the EBP,\n- whether the EBP was effective at serving BIPOC children and families,\n- the amount of support provided by the purveyor of the EBP and\n- whether or not the EBP required an evaluation. The EBPs relevant to Title IV-E prevention services implementation that was developed in the AirTable created by Children Now.37 Reviewing this AirTable provided the CDSS with information about each EBP which assisted in selecting the ten EBPs listed in Appendix A.

Any of the Title IV-E funded prevention services included in Appendix A can be chosen by local IV-E agencies to fill a service gap in the continuum of services available in each jurisdiction or to reach a population where services are not yet available to meet the local demographic\u2019s unique and culturally diverse needs. These services can also be leveraged when other funds, such as those described below, have been applied but do not cover all activities within an EBP or when a recipient does not qualify for services through other funding sources.

Accommodations can be made to the well-supported EBPs for cultural appropriateness with guidance from EBP providers to ensure model fidelity standards are maintained.

The Title IV-E Prevention Program established by FFPSA will complement California\u2019s existing capacity to further the safety and permanency of children and youth who are brought to the attention of community partners, Tribes, child welfare, or probation agencies. The Title IV-E Prevention Program provides a valuable opportunity to serve children, youth, parents, and caregivers, as well as expectant and parenting foster youth, to promote access to other prevention services and programs, and as such, may have a high need for immediate supports and services to prevent entry into the foster care system. California intends to use Title IV-E prevention funding, alongside other available funding streams, and coupled with other parallel reforms, to continue to build a comprehensive system of care which emphasizes prevention and early intervention services. In recent years, the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) has significantly increased the visibility and urgency around establishing a continuum of prevention services and supports throughout California. In partnership with CDSS, county child welfare agencies created the Child and Family Enrichment Cabinet in 2018, which currently supports 24 cross-sector collaborative prevention planning teams in developing and implementing local prevention plans. The Cabinet is comprised of ten county child welfare directors, all of whom are champions for expanding prevention. The Cabinet\u2019s mission is to inspire and support each California county to develop an integrated system of care that supports families in providing (or providing return to) safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments for their children. This integrated system\u2019s primary aim is keeping children safe at home by strengthening families through programs such as CalFRESH,\u00b2 California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) Homeless Assistance,\u00b3 CalWORKs Home Visiting,\u2074 and Differential Response.\u2075 California plans to leverage these existing prevention planning efforts to embed FFPSA-funded prevention services into a comprehensive local prevention continuum. 1.

This agency may be a community-based organization (CBO) family resource center (FRC), or Tribal Social Services. Page 15\n\nAgency contracted by the local Title IV-E agency to perform the services14. The local Title IV-E agency\u2019s role is peripheral, and its purpose is to be the authorizing entity for Title IV-E funded prevention services that determines eligibility and maintains responsibility for supervising the Title IV-E funded activities performed by the contracted community agency. Developing a community pathway is critical to an equity-centered approach to Title IV-E prevention as studies have demonstrated that \u201cracial disparities occur at various decision points in the child welfare continuum\u201d15. California\u2019s vision for prevention includes a community pathway for families to access services prior to a call being made to the child abuse hotline and for families to access services through community-based organizations when direct involvement with the local Title IV-E agency is unnecessary. Elevating the role of CBOs and FRCs as points of access for prevention services reinforces California\u2019s commitment to the vision of a true prevention continuum. # Cultural Adaptations of Evidence Based Practices (EBPs)\n\n\u201cEvidence-Based Practice\u201d is an approach to prevention or treatment that is backed by documented scientific evidence demonstrating positive outcomes in multiple research studies. Evidence can be obtained through a variety of methods such as randomized clinical trials, experimental studies, or meta-analyses16. The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) defines an EBP as an \u201cintervention which has been consistently shown in several research studies to assist consumers in achieving their desired goals of health and wellness\u201d17. Well-supported EBPs have met or exceeded a standard of sufficient evidence existing to make claims of positive outcomes for specified populations of consumers. Even well-supported EBPs may need to be modified in the future as they expand and evolve to serve the diverse cultural needs of California\u2019s families. These modifications will be planned for, encouraged, and resourced as part of FFPSA implementation. Guidance from the Administration for Children and Families, Information Memorandum 21-04, allows states to make eligible adaptations of approved programs reviewed in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse.",

Contiguous 12-month periods of services can be provided as long as the youth is assessed to have a continued need for the services. # PATHWAYS TO PREVENTION SERVICES\n\nCalifornia will provide local Title IV-E agencies the opportunity to utilize the following pathways to identify, assess and support a child or family with Title IV-E-funded prevention services. The pathways represent the ways in which vulnerable children and families may come to the attention of service providers and be approved for Title IV-E prevention services. The Family First Prevention Services Act requires collection of data to model fidelity and CQI activities involved in the prevention services. All the required FFPSA claiming data elements can be found in the Children\u2019s Bureau (August 19, 2019) Technical Bulletin #1 (REVISED): Title IV-E Prevention Program Data Elements.34 For each of the pathways below, this information will be collected in the CWS-CARES. # TITLE IV-E AGENCY PATHWAY\n\n# CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES\n\nThe Child Welfare Pathway for Title IV-E prevention services allows local child welfare agencies that are interfacing with children and families to identify, assess and support families with prevention services directly. A Child Abuse Hotline is one access point of the Child Welfare Pathway for Title IV-E funded prevention services. When the referral from the Hotline is assigned to an emergency response social worker, they contact the family to investigate the allegation(s). If the investigation results in substantiated or inconclusive findings, yet a case is not opened, a child may be identified as a\n\n34 Children\u2019s Bureau, Title IV-E Prevention Program Data Elements (June 30, 2022)\n\nPage 27\nCandidate for foster care eligible for Title IV-E Prevention Services and referred to available and appropriate prevention services under the community pathway described below. When direct involvement with the family by the local Title IV-E agency is necessary, Family Maintenance (FM) is another avenue through which families are eligible to receive voluntary or court ordered services to prevent removal of children from their homes. The FM services may occur to prevent entry into care and may be provided after reunification to prevent reentry. The FFPSA provides an opportunity for child welfare agencies to develop or expand capacity of the prevention services delivered under FM.",

An integrated system must develop a cross-collaborative network of support that meets the needs of families at every prevention level. Families\u2019 needs are diverse and cannot be addressed by any one profession or service system; those needs span public and private systems and agencies including child welfare, behavioral health, healthcare, public health, maternal and child health, education, housing and juvenile probation agencies, juvenile courts, the Child Abuse Prevention Council, First 5, childcare, and system partners. Only with programming that reaches across professions and service sectors, can California create comprehensive approaches to meeting these needs and promoting child and family well-being.",

The PAT model includes four core components, which include personal home visits, supportive group connection events, child health and developmental screenings, and community resource networks. PAT is designed so that it can be delivered to diverse families with diverse needs, although PAT sites typically target families with specific risk factors. The program is targeted to parents that are expecting or have a child 0 to 5 years of age. The Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse summary of findings indicate that the program has been shown to demonstrate an improvement in social functioning. A review of studies show evidence that PAT had increased number of developmental milestones met, increased positive parenting practices, and improvement of parent/caregiver emotional and mental health. | Parent Skill-Based | Parents/caregivers with children aged Birth to kindergarten | Increased number of developmental milestones met            | Adherence to PAT Essential Requirements                              |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                    |                                                             | Increased positive parenting practices                      | Annual submission of each essential requirement progress             |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                    |                                                             | Improvement of parent/caregiver emotional and mental health | Providing the Performance Measures Report (PMR) after APR submission |\n\n1:12 Supervisor to Staff Ratio\n\nPage 56\n\n# EBP Service, Description, Rationale, and Manual\n\n| Type of Service | Target Population                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Intended Outcomes/Proximal Outcomes Monitored for CQI |\n| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |\n| mental health   | These outcomes align with the targeted outcomes in the state including increased number of developmental milestones met, improved parenting practices, and improved parent/caregiver emotional and mental health.",

Appendix D includes the state\u2019s training plan which describes the content of each topic\u2019s curriculum. Topics infused throughout all trainings will include trauma-informed practice, ICPM, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), tribal engagement, and the community pathway. The CDSS is working with training partners to develop curriculum and creating a timeline for delivery of training. A rollout of FFPSA training for all staff is intended to happen as counties are ready to implement the FFPS Program, and recurring training will be considered as California\u2019s Five-Year State Prevention Plan is reviewed and amended. # Tier 1\n\nPrevention Principles will outline best practices that are necessary for prevention networks to understand and move toward a system-wide shift of investing in prevention. This system-oriented training will target the widest audience, including local service provider staff, leadership on all levels, and cross-sector partners. Tier 1 training and webinars will be ongoing and updated as needed for Continuous Quality Improvement. # Tier 2\n\nFoundational knowledge for direct services staff. This tier is focused on the needs of staff, supervisors and other professionals who will provide direct case coordination and services in both the Title IV-E and Community Pathway:\n\n- Training will ensure that staff from child welfare, probation, tribal agencies, and local service providers are qualified to complete intake assessments, develop prevention plans, engage with families and Tribes, understand when and how often to conduct risk assessments, monitor child safety, develop safety plans, and assess for continued appropriateness of prevention services. - Training will be offered to Title IV-E agency caseworkers and supervisors to ensure that foundational elements of the FFPS are incorporated into existing programs for family maintenance and probation service plans and ensure that the requirements of the ICWA are incorporated into training delivery. This tier of trainings will include the determination of candidacy and factor in the various ways in which families can be referred for services. Page 47\n\nTier 2 training will be delivered with a core curriculum that is tailored to be delivered based on the specific audience included in the offered pathways.",

In July of 2021, California\u2019s Family First Prevention Services Program (FFPS) was established in WIC \u00a716585 through 16589 as an opt-in program for county and tribal Title IV-E agencies to develop and implement Title IV-E prevention services as part of the continuum of comprehensive prevention and early intervention services supporting child and family well-being. In accordance with state statute, local Title IV-E agencies will be provided the option to participate in the Title IV-E Prevention Program. To supplement the state\u2019s efforts to build evidence-based prevention programming, through the passage of AB 153, California has provided local county agencies an additional $199 million through a state-funded block grant to support local efforts to expand to a full continuum of prevention services through the development of local comprehensive prevention plans (CPPs). Local Title IV-E agencies participating in the FFPS state block grant can use funds for planning purposes, capacity.

Local Title IV-E agencies are required to include Title IV-E prevention services in their local prevention plans. # REQUIREMENTS FOR PARTICIPATING TITLE IV-E AGENCIES\n\nTo create their Comprehensive Prevention Plan (CPP), local Title IV-E agencies are encouraged to leverage and build upon existing partnerships which are anchored within its larger System of Care continuum. Title IV-E agencies may plan to expand, repurpose, or create cross-sector partnerships which include membership from child welfare, probation, behavioral health, and Tribes, tribal organizations, consortium, and tribal service providers at a minimum. Title IV-E agencies have been strongly encouraged to additionally include partners in education, health care, developmental services, education, community-based organizations including Family Resource Centers and Child Abuse Prevention Centers, as well as to place a special focus on meaningfully involving parents/primary caregivers and youth with lived experiences.",

NFP is a home-visiting program that is typically implemented by trained registered nurses. NFP serves young, first-time, low-income mothers beginning early in their pregnancy until the child turns two. The primary aims of NFP are to improve the health, relationships, and economic well-being of mothers and their children. Typically, nurses provide support related to individualized goal setting, preventative health practices, parenting skills, and educational and career planning. However, the content of the program can vary based on the needs and requests of the mother. NFP aims for 60 visits that last 60-75 minutes each in the home or a location of the mother\u2019s choosing. For the first month after enrollment, visits occur weekly.",

The county must also consult with other relevant county agencies that serve families and children that include, Indian Tribes, local community representatives, caseworkers, and individuals and families with lived experience with the child welfare system regarding any changes to the plan. # Approval Process\n\nThe CDSS will review and approve all local plans submitted to opt into the FFPS program. Technical Assistance will be available to local Title IV-E agencies to ensure that their plans meet the aforementioned requirements and include all the required assurances to ensure compliance with federal and state statute and the state\u2019s Five-Year Title IV-E Prevention plan. Local Title IV-E Agencies who opt-in and/or submit a CPP may later determine they are unable to fulfill the requirements of the CPP or may subsequently choose to opt out of the FFPS program. Local Title IV-E agencies must promptly notify the CDSS of any changes and may only claim FFPS State Block Grant funds for allowable expenditures prior to opting out.

For a large state that is state-supervised and county-administered, with 58 local Title IV-E agencies to serve, devising a training system that adequately addresses needs statewide requires thoughtful planning, rigorous standards, and built-in flexibility. California\u2019s 58 county child welfare services programs range from rural to highly urbanized, with workforces ranging from just a few workers to a staff of thousands. Training sophistication ranges from informal grass-roots workforce development efforts to highly developed training departments with complex learning management systems.",

In California, the Regional Training Academies (RTAs) provide a continuum of training and professional educational opportunities for child welfare and Title IV-E Tribal staff through the State. This structure currently includes regional delivery of foundational and ad hoc trainings through five RTAs with curricula coordinated by the California Social Work Education Center (CalSWEC). Additional training resources also include the Center for Human Services at University of California at Davis Extension, the Resource Center for Family-Focused Practice (RCFFP) which focuses on family centered practice, Tribal STAR at San Diego State University Academy for Professional Excellence, which provides training and technical assistance (TA) to child welfare social workers, legal advocates, Tribal Nations and Tribal Social Service agencies in 5 Southern California counties, CalTrin and Strategies TA, which provides trainings to local service providers including Family Resource Center and community-based agency staff, and the Chief Probation Officers of California which develops and delivers foundational, supervisory and ad hoc training on child welfare practices to their members. California will leverage current training in place that have topics related to ensuring successful delivery of Family First Prevention Services. Core curriculum for child welfare staff, known as Common Core, already consists of a combination of classroom and field training on topics such as:\n\n- Trauma-informed practice\n- Integrated Core Practice Model (ICPM)\n- Tribal Engagement, ICWA including Active Efforts and culturally appropriate programs\n- Equity & cultural humility\n- Engaging children & families\n- Case planning with families and county partners\n- Conducting risk assessments, including use of assessment tools\n\nPage 46\n\n# Monitoring child safety\n\n- Key issues in child welfare, including behavioral health, substance use disorders, and intimate partner violence\n- Data systems & reporting\n\nThe RTAs are currently able to track workforce training and conduct evaluations of child welfare staff through pre-and post-surveys using an online learning and management system. Local agencies are provided access to this system, so tracking and evaluation of workforce development can be expanded to include probation, Tribes, and community pathway partners.",
