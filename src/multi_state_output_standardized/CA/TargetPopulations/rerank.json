NFP is a home-visiting program that is typically implemented by trained registered nurses. NFP serves young, first-time, low-income mothers beginning early in their pregnancy until the child turns two. The primary aims of NFP are to improve the health, relationships, and economic well-being of mothers and their children. Typically, nurses provide support related to individualized goal setting, preventative health practices, parenting skills, and educational and career planning. However, the content of the program can vary based on the needs and requests of the mother. NFP aims for 60 visits that last 60-75 minutes each in the home or a location of the mother\u2019s choosing. For the first month after enrollment, visits occur weekly.",

California recognizes that families are complex and dynamic, therefore assessments must view the family history in context with current circumstances to best understand their needs. For example, a family may have risk factors such as an historical mental health or substance use diagnosis, but the current circumstance of a hospitalization or substance use relapse may place the child or youth at imminent risk of removal and foster care placement. In these situations, when there is a recommendation that a prevention service may provide supports and interventions that mitigate such safety threats, a determination of candidacy can be made. Other examples of imminent circumstances may include but are not limited to:\n\n- Current or recent (within 6 months) family involvement with social services agency\n- Change in family relationships characterized by frequent conflict or violence;\n- Recent increase in substance use that impacts daily functioning and ability to care for the child or youth;\n- Recent incident in which a parent or guardian made a plausible threat to cause serious physical harm to a child or youth;\n- Incarceration of the caregiver;\n- Child or youth participated in criminal activity; and\n- Other recent or current circumstance that may cause family instability or a threat to the child/youth\u2019s safety or well-being. For a child or youth entering the Title IV-E prevention program through the Community Pathway, the initial assessment of the family can be completed by a locally contracted Community Based Organization, Family Resource Center or a local behavioral health agency.",

The PAT model includes four core components, which include personal home visits, supportive group connection events, child health and developmental screenings, and community resource networks. PAT is designed so that it can be delivered to diverse families with diverse needs, although PAT sites typically target families with specific risk factors.

Los Angeles, California\u2019s largest county as well as the nation\u2019s largest child welfare system, is currently implementing BSFT. Additionally, BSFT is one of the few EBPs that can be used with children 6-18, giving it an important role in ensuring coverage of mental health support within the prevention continuum for school-aged children and adolescents. A study on the efficacy of BSFT shows significantly greater improvement in parent\u2019s reports of adolescent conduct programs and delinquency and adolescent reports of marijuana use as well as emotional functioning of the family. Another study showed the use of BSFT significantly decreased parent\u2019s alcohol use. 50 Brief Strategic Family Therapy, https://brief-strategic-family-therapy.com/what-we-do/\n\n51 Santisteban, D., Perez-Vidal, A., Coatsworth, J., Kurtines, W., Schwartz, S., LaPerriere, A., & Szapocznik, J.

The Title IV-E Prevention Program established by FFPSA will complement California\u2019s existing capacity to further the safety and permanency of children and youth who are brought to the attention of community partners, Tribes, child welfare, or probation agencies. The Title IV-E Prevention Program provides a valuable opportunity to serve children, youth, parents, and caregivers, as well as expectant and parenting foster youth, to promote access to other prevention services and programs, and as such, may have a high need for immediate supports and services to prevent entry into the foster care system. California intends to use Title IV-E prevention funding, alongside other available funding streams, and coupled with other parallel reforms, to continue to build a comprehensive system of care which emphasizes prevention and early intervention services. In recent years, the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) has significantly increased the visibility and urgency around establishing a continuum of prevention services and supports throughout California. In partnership with CDSS, county child welfare agencies created the Child and Family Enrichment Cabinet in 2018, which currently supports 24 cross-sector collaborative prevention planning teams in developing and implementing local prevention plans. The Cabinet is comprised of ten county child welfare directors, all of whom are champions for expanding prevention. The Cabinet\u2019s mission is to inspire and support each California county to develop an integrated system of care that supports families in providing (or providing return to) safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments for their children. This integrated system\u2019s primary aim is keeping children safe at home by strengthening families through programs such as CalFRESH,\u00b2 California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) Homeless Assistance,\u00b3 CalWORKs Home Visiting,\u2074 and Differential Response.\u2075 California plans to leverage these existing prevention planning efforts to embed FFPSA-funded prevention services into a comprehensive local prevention continuum. 1.

This section describes California\u2019s strategies for the initial selection of EBPs to launch the implementation of the Title IV-E Prevention Program established by the FFPSA. The CDSS reviewed several criteria to select EBPs for California\u2019s population the target population to include in the prevention state service array, including:\n\n- the extent to which the EBP was currently being implemented in California,\n- the qualifications of those who would be delivering the EBP,\n- the eligibility requirements of the EBP,\n- whether the EBP was effective at serving BIPOC children and families,\n- the amount of support provided by the purveyor of the EBP and\n- whether or not the EBP required an evaluation. The EBPs relevant to Title IV-E prevention services implementation that was developed in the AirTable created by Children Now.37 Reviewing this AirTable provided the CDSS with information about each EBP which assisted in selecting the ten EBPs listed in Appendix A.

Since the spring of 2019, the CDSS convened multiple stakeholder workgroups, including a widely attended Prevention Summit, designed to orient stakeholders, and gauge their needs and readiness to implement prevention services. The CDSS sought feedback through a detailed survey process, as well as through focused conversations with Child Welfare Directors, Chief Probation Officers, youth and parents with lived experience, service providers, and training academies. The CDSS will continue to reach out to varied partners and stakeholders as the Title IV-E Prevention Program is implemented. In addition, the CDSS has committed to an annual planning update process in collaboration with counties and stakeholders, and in consultation with Tribes. At that time, program enhancements such as adding EBPs or modifying candidacy populations may be considered. Page 20\n\n# Tribal Consultation\n\nThroughout the development of the prevention plan, the CDSS regularly engaged Tribes by requesting and engaging in formal government to government Tribal Consultations and through engagement of the Tribal Advisory Committee to solicit input on the development of the Title IV-E Prevention Program. The Tribal Advisory Committee convened in the fall/winter of 2021, where CDSS presented feedback on the state plan to respond to the Children\u2019s Bureau feedback and assisted drafting the most recent version of the Plan. # CHILD AND FAMILY ELIGIBILITY\n\n# CANDIDATES FOR FOSTER CARE\n\nThe FFPSA defines a candidate for foster care as a child who is identified in a prevention plan as being at imminent risk of entering foster care, but who can remain safely in the child\u2019s home or in a kinship placement if eligible prevention services that are necessary to prevent the entry of the child into foster care are provided. The CDSS has analyzed historical data from 2016-2019 and collaborated with various stakeholders to identify methods for determining which children and families are eligible for referral for Title IV-E prevention services under FFPSA. California recognizes that while categories of children and families eligible for prevention services can be identified and referred, actual \u201cimminent risk\u201d of foster care entry and candidacy can only be determined on a case-by-case basis, with thoughtful consideration for each child and change family\u2019s unique needs and circumstances, and with use of an unbiased process and/or tools to assess risk.",

An integrated system must develop a cross-collaborative network of support that meets the needs of families at every prevention level. Families\u2019 needs are diverse and cannot be addressed by any one profession or service system; those needs span public and private systems and agencies including child welfare, behavioral health, healthcare, public health, maternal and child health, education, housing and juvenile probation agencies, juvenile courts, the Child Abuse Prevention Council, First 5, childcare, and system partners. Only with programming that reaches across professions and service sectors, can California create comprehensive approaches to meeting these needs and promoting child and family well-being.",

Following consultation with counties, Tribes, and community-based organizations, as well as those with lived experience, California has determined that if a child falls within one of the categories specified below, the child can be considered for eligibility for Title IV-E prevention services. While the groups described below are at increased risk of foster care, a case-by-case, individualized assessment will be required to determine whether an individual child within that category meets the criteria of being at imminent risk of entering foster care. The following children are currently considered candidates for foster care under the existing Title IV-E foster care program and may be eligible for prevention services under Title IV-E based upon an individual assessment and determination that the child is at imminent risk of entering foster care but can remain safely in the home as long as allowable mental health, substance use, and/or in-home parent skill-based program services are provided.
