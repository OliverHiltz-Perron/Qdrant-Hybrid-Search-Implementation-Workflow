In California, the Regional Training Academies (RTAs) provide a continuum of training and professional educational opportunities for child welfare and Title IV-E Tribal staff through the State. This structure currently includes regional delivery of foundational and ad hoc trainings through five RTAs with curricula coordinated by the California Social Work Education Center (CalSWEC). Additional training resources also include the Center for Human Services at University of California at Davis Extension, the Resource Center for Family-Focused Practice (RCFFP) which focuses on family centered practice, Tribal STAR at San Diego State University Academy for Professional Excellence, which provides training and technical assistance (TA) to child welfare social workers, legal advocates, Tribal Nations and Tribal Social Service agencies in 5 Southern California counties, CalTrin and Strategies TA, which provides trainings to local service providers including Family Resource Center and community-based agency staff, and the Chief Probation Officers of California which develops and delivers foundational, supervisory and ad hoc training on child welfare practices to their members. California will leverage current training in place that have topics related to ensuring successful delivery of Family First Prevention Services. Core curriculum for child welfare staff, known as Common Core, already consists of a combination of classroom and field training on topics such as:\n\n- Trauma-informed practice\n- Integrated Core Practice Model (ICPM)\n- Tribal Engagement, ICWA including Active Efforts and culturally appropriate programs\n- Equity & cultural humility\n- Engaging children & families\n- Case planning with families and county partners\n- Conducting risk assessments, including use of assessment tools\n\nPage 46\n\n# Monitoring child safety\n\n- Key issues in child welfare, including behavioral health, substance use disorders, and intimate partner violence\n- Data systems & reporting\n\nThe RTAs are currently able to track workforce training and conduct evaluations of child welfare staff through pre-and post-surveys using an online learning and management system. Local agencies are provided access to this system, so tracking and evaluation of workforce development can be expanded to include probation, Tribes, and community pathway partners.",

Topics infused throughout all trainings will include trauma-informed practice, ICPM, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), tribal engagement, and the community pathway. The CDSS is working with training partners to develop curriculum and creating a timeline for delivery of training. A rollout of FFPSA training for all staff is intended to happen as counties are ready to implement the FFPS Program, and recurring training will be considered as California\u2019s Five-Year State Prevention Plan is reviewed and amended. # Tier 1\n\nPrevention Principles will outline best practices that are necessary for prevention networks to understand and move toward a system-wide shift of investing in prevention. This system-oriented training will target the widest audience, including local service provider staff, leadership on all levels, and cross-sector partners. Tier 1 training and webinars will be ongoing and updated as needed for Continuous Quality Improvement. # Tier 2\n\nFoundational knowledge for direct services staff. This tier is focused on the needs of staff, supervisors and other professionals who will provide direct case coordination and services in both the Title IV-E and Community Pathway:\n\n- Training will ensure that staff from child welfare, probation, tribal agencies, and local service providers are qualified to complete intake assessments, develop prevention plans, engage with families and Tribes, understand when and how often to conduct risk assessments, monitor child safety, develop safety plans, and assess for continued appropriateness of prevention services. - Training will be offered to Title IV-E agency caseworkers and supervisors to ensure that foundational elements of the FFPS are incorporated into existing programs for family maintenance and probation service plans and ensure that the requirements of the ICWA are incorporated into training delivery. This tier of trainings will include the determination of candidacy and factor in the various ways in which families can be referred for services.

Page 49\n\n# PREVENTION CASELOAD\n\nAs California is a state supervised county administered system, caseload monitoring is dependent on local Title IV-E agencies, which will be directly responsible for ensuring appropriate caseloads for agency and contracted caseworkers. In California there is no required standard case load minimum or maximum. The chart below from the CDSS 2020 Realignment Report describes a representative sample of caseloads in California, including Family maintenance cases during the Title IV-E waiver demonstration project. The Realignment data demonstrates that in family maintenance there is a range of 13.5-18.7 cases per caseworker across the five waiver counties. This caseload representation is most closely aligned with what is anticipated to occur in the FFPS program. Counties can compare this data to prevention caseloads as an expectation of what caseloads should be, however will also need to consider the complexity of family needs and adjust accordingly to meet those needs and the needs of staff. Using existing protocols for case assignment, caseloads will be determined at the local level, based on the complexity of family needs. Social worker supervisors of the local Title IV-E agencies are trained to monitor caseloads of individual caseworkers and can promptly address any issues impacting the effective performance of case management activities and the provision of services to families. Local Title IV-E agency contracts with other agencies or community-based organizations for delivering EBPs must specify that caseload levels will be monitored by the local Title IV-E agency to ensure that model fidelity is maintained where an EBP is being used. Where model fidelity does not dictate a prescribed caseload size, ongoing assessment of family needs and the time invested in the family\u2019s service or intervention must be taken into consideration to prevent caseloads from becoming unmanageable. Prevention caseload numbers will be tracked through CWS-CARES and available for analysis throughout the continuous monitoring of the FFPS program. Local Title IV-E agencies will describe in their CPP additional local strategies or protocols for how caseload size and type for prevention caseload size and the type of prevention case assignments will be determined, managed, and monitored. Any client to provider ratio shall not apply to any Medi-Cal delivery systems.",

California has taken, and will continue to take, steps to improve and increase relevant trainings, such as cultural humility and implicit bias trainings, within child welfare agencies to reduce racial biases. In 2010, the CDSS received a federal grant to create the California Partners for Permanency Project (CAPP). The CAPP\u2019s goal was to improve permanency outcomes for all children and reduce disparities in permanency outcomes for African American and American Indian children in or entering Long Term Foster Care (LTFC). The CAPP implemented a Child and Family Practice Model (a precursor to the Integrated Core Practice Model now being used) that included culturally appropriate engagement; empowerment of family, tribal, and community networks; and use of culturally appropriate healing practices and practice adaptations.\u00b9\u00b3\n\nThe CAPP promoted strategies such as (1) ensuring the system becomes aware of, and more sensitively interprets, the cultural values and traditions of families being served as strengths; and (2) ensuring access to, and supporting use of, well-being and healing practices that are relevant and meaningful to the family and its culture. While these strategies were important in improving responsiveness to culture and trauma, CAPP also found that California\u2019s child welfare systems needed to be changed. Through the CAPP work, the CDSS discovered that in order to provide some of the more culturally appropriate supports that are needed for families to heal, the child welfare system must first develop or adapt internal business processes and fiscal mechanisms to effectively host and integrate those supports and services. Another important lesson learned from the CAPP Project is the level of investment needed for a sufficient, stable, trained, and well-coached workforce that can effectively deliver evidence-based or evidence-informed practices with fidelity. Without fidelity to the model, the child and family outcomes promised are unlikely to manifest.",

The CDSS plans to engage external experts as well as local Title IV-E Agencies, Tribes, and program developers to develop standardized, statewide approaches to fidelity monitoring and CQI for each specific EBP which is part of the Title IV-E Prevention Plan. This statewide approach will draw upon any available technical assistance and training from each EBPs program developer. Each EBP has \u201cessential requirements\u201d and \u201cquality standards\u201d to which providers must adhere to in order to implement the EBP with fidelity to the practice model. These requirements and standards typically include training and supervision requirements, as well as specific commitments to various model requirements. Some EBPs include case review, consultation, specified assessment tools and protocols, as well as technical assistance activities as additional tools that work to ensure interventions are being delivered with fidelity to the practice model. It is anticipated that local service provider contracts will be developed or amended to include fidelity monitoring and CQI processes and requirements in accordance with state-issued guidance to ensure standardized practice for each EBP being implemented at various localities throughout the State. The CDSS will hire a contractor to assist in the development of a proposal for model fidelity oversight of EBP\u2019s across implementation sites. With guidance from the contractor, the program\u2019s governance structure, and the State Prevention Advisory Committee, the CDSS will describe the process by which model fidelity of the programs will be overseen within each individual provider contract. Additionally, data will be collected from each provider either through the model fidelity oversight process developed within the CDSS contract and to the extent that CWS-CARES can collect the information or if there are additional ways to leverage other data systems through CWS-CARES to collect the data. Essentially the data will either come directly from the providers or from CWS-CARES.

Prevention activities must focus on trauma mitigation, reduction of negative consequences, and prevention of recurrence. If child maltreatment is not prevented, recurrence could result in detention of children and youth, and their placement in foster care. Tertiary strategic objectives include:\n\n- Providing family preservation or reunification services;\n- Providing permanency planning;\n- Offering parent support groups that help parents strengthen positive parenting behaviors and attitudes\\*;\n- Providing behavioral health and wellness services for children, youth, and families affected by maltreatment\\*; and\n- Providing parent mentoring programs to families in crisis\\*. - Strategic objectives are aligned with FFPSA-eligible services\\*\n\n# EQUITY AND INCLUSION AS A PRIMARY LENS\n\nBlack/brown, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) face particular disparities and disproportionalities in service access and outcomes that stem from historical inequities and systemic factors. This plan has been created to reflect California\u2019s ongoing commitment to increasing equitable approaches to child and family well-being and addressing the disparities that impact BIPOC families. An \u2018equity and inclusion\u2019 lens will precede every phase of planning, design, and implementation of FFPSA as a part of broad prevention efforts. An equity lens prescribes that family experiences and perceptions are a key data source for driving program design, and that qualitative data are equally valued as quantitative data. The CDSS has created intentional and targeted engagement with youth and parents to gather feedback on the Five-Year State Prevention Plan and will continue to engage these individuals and communities in a culturally appropriate way throughout implementation.",

Page 29\n\nAlthough tools may be different, the case plan identifies the required assessment creating a standard across all probation departments and ensures that ongoing assessment is occurring. The CDSS will ensure through the development of guidance to Title IV-E agencies that regular, ongoing safety monitoring and periodic risk assessments are included in local policies and procedures. Periodic risk assessments will also ensure that the child and family are assessed at minimum to ensure services are appropriate through a 12-month period. Per existing guidance in All County Letter (ACL) 14-36, probation officer contact requirements include ongoing monitoring of physical and emotional condition as well as adherence to the case plan including documentation of the progress towards the established goals in the family\u2019s case plan. The Case Plan will determine the needs and frequency of ongoing safety and risk monitoring. During the 12-month period the probation officer is required to visit the child and family at a minimum of once per month where these activities will occur and complete new Case Plan every 6 months while the child remains a reasonable candidate for prevention services. Re-determination for candidacy shall be updated no less than every six months or as a new change occurs and will be done by completing both the \u201cEvaluation of Imminent Risk and Reasonable Candidacy\u201d document and new Case Plan. Probation Departments who opt into providing Title IV-E prevention services will use CWS-CARES for all case documentation, including candidacy determinations, ongoing safety and risk assessments, and fiscal reporting. This will ensure that prevention cases overseen by probation departments conform with the state\u2019s prevention plan and are aligned with all model fidelity and continuous monitoring processes as required. While prevention services data reporting will be collected through CWS-CARES, additional assessment tools beyond the FFPSA prevention services candidacy determination tool will be discussed and evaluated during the CWS-CARES Project\u2019s research and development work currently underway. # COMMUNITY PATHWAY\n\nCentral to California\u2019s vision for a robust prevention continuum is expanding the services and supports universally for all children, youth, and families. Struggling families, especially those residing in impoverished neighborhoods, often voluntarily seek support from public and private community agencies, such as faith-based organizations, schools, local athletic organizations, after school programs, scouting organizations, etc.",
