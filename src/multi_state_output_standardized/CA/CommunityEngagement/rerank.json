Since the spring of 2019, the CDSS convened multiple stakeholder workgroups, including a widely attended Prevention Summit, designed to orient stakeholders, and gauge their needs and readiness to implement prevention services. The CDSS sought feedback through a detailed survey process, as well as through focused conversations with Child Welfare Directors, Chief Probation Officers, youth and parents with lived experience, service providers, and training academies. The CDSS will continue to reach out to varied partners and stakeholders as the Title IV-E Prevention Program is implemented. In addition, the CDSS has committed to an annual planning update process in collaboration with counties and stakeholders, and in consultation with Tribes. At that time, program enhancements such as adding EBPs or modifying candidacy populations may be considered. Page 20\n\n# Tribal Consultation\n\nThroughout the development of the prevention plan, the CDSS regularly engaged Tribes by requesting and engaging in formal government to government Tribal Consultations and through engagement of the Tribal Advisory Committee to solicit input on the development of the Title IV-E Prevention Program. The Tribal Advisory Committee convened in the fall/winter of 2021, where CDSS presented feedback on the state plan to respond to the Children\u2019s Bureau feedback and assisted drafting the most recent version of the Plan. # CHILD AND FAMILY ELIGIBILITY\n\n# CANDIDATES FOR FOSTER CARE\n\nThe FFPSA defines a candidate for foster care as a child who is identified in a prevention plan as being at imminent risk of entering foster care, but who can remain safely in the child\u2019s home or in a kinship placement if eligible prevention services that are necessary to prevent the entry of the child into foster care are provided. The CDSS has analyzed historical data from 2016-2019 and collaborated with various stakeholders to identify methods for determining which children and families are eligible for referral for Title IV-E prevention services under FFPSA. California recognizes that while categories of children and families eligible for prevention services can be identified and referred, actual \u201cimminent risk\u201d of foster care entry and candidacy can only be determined on a case-by-case basis, with thoughtful consideration for each child and change family\u2019s unique needs and circumstances, and with use of an unbiased process and/or tools to assess risk.",

It is critical that there is sufficient capacity to deliver services to meet the demand for early intervention with\n\nPage 19\n\nmore families, and to serve the diverse needs of California families. Local service organizations may be contracted with to conduct assessments of the family\u2019s strengths and needs, recommend and/or plan treatment, provide case management services, and provide aftercare services. Readiness work is intended to expose gaps in the local service array which can be strategically filled by targeted service procurement by county agencies. # Re-Centering Lived Experience\n\nAs stated earlier, the CDSS considers family experiences and perceptions to be a key data source, where qualitative data are equally valued as quantitative data, and that an equity and inclusion lens will precede every phase of planning, design, and implementation. The CDSS has created intentional and targeted engagement with youth and parents to gather feedback on this Plan. Groups involved include Parents Anonymous, the California Youth Connection, the Youth Empowerment Project, and the Citizen Review Panels. These same groups that provided plan feedback will also serve as venues to discuss implementation and will serve CDSS in the creation of an advisory body which centers lived experience and influences the local and statewide implementation processes. The CDSS also considers teaming models (e.g., child and family teams, family team decision making) to be a strategy that, if deployed correctly, centers the lived experience of families in crisis and leverages families\u2019 inherent strengths and resilience to remediate the crisis. Together, teams create exponential energy and connect families to resources to meet the family\u2019s needs and support their success. In a complex service system like California, work product is created through a series of business processes which support the mission of the organization, county systems, and provider contractors. Healing from trauma and connecting youth to their natural and community supports can be challenging in government-operated systems. The key elements of the ICPM such as engagement, assessment, service planning and delivery, monitoring and adapting, and transition, not only guide existing policy and training, but also undergird this Prevention Plan.",

Page 30\n\n# Referral, Intake and Assessment\n\nThe community pathway is an avenue in which children, youth and families can receive early intervention services at the earliest point possible to minimize the stigma of working directly with the child welfare agency. Through the community pathway, families can self-refer, or be referred by a public or private entity such as a school, healthcare provider, or local organization. Families may also be referred to the community pathway by a local Title IV-E agency that determines a family is eligible for prevention services, but a Family Maintenance case will not be opened. These referrals can identify for families the local service provider that is contracted by the Title IV-E agency for prevention services who will complete an intake assessment of the family\u2019s strengths and needs. During the intake process, the contracted agency will complete an assessment of the circumstances of the child/family. If the child/family is assessed to need mental health, substance abuse, and/or in-home parenting skill-based services for the child to remain safely at home, they will identify the child as potentially eligible for Title IV-E prevention services. # Candidacy Determination\n\nIf the local service provider identifies a child, they believe may be an eligible candidate and can provide a Title IV-E prevention service to mitigate the family\u2019s risk and safety concerns, they can submit their recommendation for candidacy to the Title IV-E agency for a review to make a candidacy determination, with appropriate consent from the family. This interaction between the local service provider and the Title IV-E agency will protect family privacy by using a unique case identifier. # Prevention Planning, Coordination of Delivery of Services\n\nUpon notification of candidacy determination, the local service provider must begin prevention planning with the family and, if applicable, in partnership with the child\u2019s Tribe(s). If more than one service is to be provided, the contracted service provider and the Title IV-E Agency will determine the roles of care coordination and how the agencies ensure that community-based prevention services are provided to support the family\u2019s unique needs. The local service provider, in partnership with the child\u2019s Tribe(s), determine how case management and coordination of services will be conducted.",

Page 10\n\nThe data provided by the California Child Welfare Indicators Project (CCWIP) at the University of California, Berkeley demonstrate American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) and Black families are over-represented and experience disparity in most aspects of California\u2019s child welfare system. This data (depicted in Appendix B) show that Black and AI/AN children and youth are disproportionately more likely to be involved in the child welfare system, to be the subject of child maltreatment allegations, and to be placed in foster care. Black and AI/AN children and youth disproportionately yield high abuse and neglect substantiation rates, as well as higher rates of entry and re-entry to foster care, while AI/AN and Asian/Pacific Islander children have a higher rate of short stays in foster care. Furthermore, poverty (economic inequity) and structural racism are contributing factors to these disproportionalities and disparities. While the following section focuses on systemic data regarding Black and AI/AN, many of the same inequities contribute to adverse outcomes for Latino families and families with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ+) children or youth. California fully intends to develop a Title IV-E Prevention Program whose service array contains evidence-based practices (EBPs) which have proven success with historically underserved racial and ethnic groups or can be adaptable to meet cultural needs when identified. In 2020, the CCWIP reported there were 60,045 children and youth aged 0-20 in California\u2019s Child Welfare system served by local Title IV-E Agencies. According to the 2019 CCWIP data, African American or Black children and youth make up 21.5 percent of the foster system but are only 5.6 percent of the general California population and are 2.8 times more likely to be reported as victims in child maltreatment allegations than white children. Also, per CCWIP in 2019, Hispanic or Latino children and youth entered foster care at a rate of 3.6 per 1,000 children, and American Indian children and youth at a rate of 8.6 per 1,000 children.",

Local Title IV-E agencies must also partner with Tribes to ensure that culturally appropriate services are available at the local level to meet the needs of Indian children and families who are served through the community pathway. # CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE PROGRAMMING\n\nThe CDSS recognizes the need to identify culturally appropriate services for evaluation and inclusion both in the state\u2019s prevention plan and the Title IV-E Prevention Clearinghouse before they can be implemented locally and eligible for Title IV-E reimbursement. The CDSS will encourage and support local Title IV-E agencies to implement available cultural adaptations to services that meet the cultural needs of diverse groups, particularly those disproportionately represented in the child welfare system including tribal families. In addition, jurisdictions participating in the state\u2019s Family First Prevention Services Program will be able to supplement Title IV-E prevention services with culturally appropriate programs not yet eligible for Title IV-E reimbursement using additional funds that are provided to those counties who opt in. Funding from other sources supporting prevention activities can be leveraged to accomplish these goals, including use of state funds through the Family First Prevention Program state block grant. These funds can also be used to contract directly with Tribes to build service capacity and/or provide services to their members. # CALIFORNIA TRIBES WITH A TITLE IV-E AGREEMENT WITH CDSS\n\nTribes that have a Title IV-E agreement with the State pursuant to WIC Sections 10553.1 and WIC Sections 16000.6 to operate, independent of counties, a Title IV-E program may opt to directly provide Title IV-E prevention services.",

Ultimately, the ten (10) EBPs chosen are all well-supported EBPs in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse and listed in Appendix A. For each of these EBPs, California is requesting a waiver of the evaluation requirement due to the compelling effectiveness of the practices and adherence to continuous quality improvement processes included in the design.

Depending on the current level of local ability to provide prevention programming, agencies are encouraged to begin the planning process with capacity assessments conducted locally. This information, as well as information gathered during the asset mapping and strengths and needs assessment process, will enable them to assess whether their current service array meets local identified needs, and how Title IV-E funded prevention services might fill any identified gaps. Asset mapping is a process whereby a community\u2019s assets are specifically identified, described, and often visualized geographically on a map. This process provides information about the strengths and resources of a community, can help uncover solutions, and assists with thinking. 37 Children Now AirTable, Prevention Services Inventory\n\nPage 36\nof how to build on current assets to address community needs and improve wellbeing. Similarly, a strength and needs assessment is a process by which information and data is gathered regarding the needs of a community. These assessment steps are conducted to determine specified needs and strengths which lead to the development of action steps. In this way, counties will be able to align Title IV-E funded EBP selection and implementation timelines based on the demonstrated needs of their jurisdiction as evidenced by the data collected from the asset map and strength and needs assessment. As local Title IV-E agencies begin their planning process, county child welfare agencies must engage local Tribes on the decision to opt in and the services for inclusion in the local Comprehensive Prevention Plan (CPP). Communication with representatives of local tribes must include the outcome and reasons for decisions made regarding the services in the local CPP. Local Title IV-E agencies must also partner with local Tribes when developing a CPP to outline how services to Indian families will be provided, and to ensure that the plan meets the unique needs of Indian children and families and ensures access to culturally appropriate services. During the assessment phase, local Title IV-E agencies are encouraged to map existing local funding sources to better understand how these funds can be leveraged and combined with other eligible funding sources. This could include funding for traditional services, especially those used by Tribes, that meet cultural needs but may not yet be eligible for Title IV-E funding, and funding for the evaluations that may be required to meet the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse criteria to permit use of Title IV-E funding for supported and/or promising EBPs.",

An integrated system must develop a cross-collaborative network of support that meets the needs of families at every prevention level. Families\u2019 needs are diverse and cannot be addressed by any one profession or service system; those needs span public and private systems and agencies including child welfare, behavioral health, healthcare, public health, maternal and child health, education, housing and juvenile probation agencies, juvenile courts, the Child Abuse Prevention Council, First 5, childcare, and system partners. Only with programming that reaches across professions and service sectors, can California create comprehensive approaches to meeting these needs and promoting child and family well-being.",

In addition, California will prioritize including EBPs which include direct services to parents. # CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT\n\n# OUTCOME ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\nA coordinated approach to CQI will determine protocols for regular assessment of service delivery, measuring effectiveness, and how lessons learned can improve future practice. The CDSS plans to engage external experts as well as local Title IV-E Agencies, Tribes, and program developers to develop standardized, statewide approaches to fidelity monitoring and CQI for each specific EBP which is part of the Title IV-E Prevention Plan. This statewide approach will draw upon any available technical assistance and training from each EBPs program developer. Each EBP has \u201cessential requirements\u201d and \u201cquality standards\u201d to which providers must adhere to in order to implement the EBP with fidelity to the practice model. These requirements and standards typically include training and supervision requirements, as well as specific commitments to various model requirements. Some EBPs include case review, consultation, specified assessment tools and protocols, as well as technical assistance activities as additional tools that work to ensure interventions are being delivered with fidelity to the practice model. It is anticipated that local service provider contracts will be developed or amended to include fidelity monitoring and CQI processes and requirements in accordance with state-issued guidance to ensure standardized practice for each EBP being implemented at various localities throughout the State. The CDSS will hire a contractor to assist in the development of a proposal for model fidelity oversight of EBP\u2019s across implementation sites. With guidance from the contractor, the program\u2019s governance structure, and the State Prevention Advisory Committee, the CDSS will describe the process by which model fidelity of the programs will be overseen within each individual provider contract. Additionally, data will be collected from each provider either through the model fidelity oversight process developed within the CDSS contract and to the extent that CWS-CARES can collect the information or if there are additional ways to leverage other data systems through CWS-CARES to collect the data. Essentially the data will either come directly from the providers or from CWS-CARES. The CDSS will conduct periodic\n\nPage 39\n\nreviews to assess and monitor fidelity of each EBP across local agencies and work with the purveyor to provide resources for improvements and course corrections.

In the community pathway these children and youth are determined to be at imminent risk of foster care. Because provision of Title IV-E prevention services is at the county\u2019s option, those counties who utilize DR will need to align their community and Title IV-E agency pathways with the paths they have created in their DR program to ensure that candidacy decisions are made by the Title IV-E agency and that reporting requirements and model fidelity are followed.",
