Page 10\n\nThe data provided by the California Child Welfare Indicators Project (CCWIP) at the University of California, Berkeley demonstrate American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) and Black families are over-represented and experience disparity in most aspects of California\u2019s child welfare system. This data (depicted in Appendix B) show that Black and AI/AN children and youth are disproportionately more likely to be involved in the child welfare system, to be the subject of child maltreatment allegations, and to be placed in foster care. Black and AI/AN children and youth disproportionately yield high abuse and neglect substantiation rates, as well as higher rates of entry and re-entry to foster care, while AI/AN and Asian/Pacific Islander children have a higher rate of short stays in foster care. Furthermore, poverty (economic inequity) and structural racism are contributing factors to these disproportionalities and disparities. While the following section focuses on systemic data regarding Black and AI/AN, many of the same inequities contribute to adverse outcomes for Latino families and families with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ+) children or youth. California fully intends to develop a Title IV-E Prevention Program whose service array contains evidence-based practices (EBPs) which have proven success with historically underserved racial and ethnic groups or can be adaptable to meet cultural needs when identified. In 2020, the CCWIP reported there were 60,045 children and youth aged 0-20 in California\u2019s Child Welfare system served by local Title IV-E Agencies. According to the 2019 CCWIP data, African American or Black children and youth make up 21.5 percent of the foster system but are only 5.6 percent of the general California population and are 2.8 times more likely to be reported as victims in child maltreatment allegations than white children. Also, per CCWIP in 2019, Hispanic or Latino children and youth entered foster care at a rate of 3.6 per 1,000 children, and American Indian children and youth at a rate of 8.6 per 1,000 children.",

The following innovations reflect California\u2019s investment in cross-system practice:\n\n# Integrated Core Practice Model\n\nGrounding cross-system work at every level is the statewide Integrated Core Practice Model (ICPM).18 The ICPM is a practical guide to support county child welfare, juvenile probation, behavioral health agencies, and community partners to improve delivery of timely, effective, and integrated services to children, youth, and families. The ICPM requires a commitment to shared values and practices, building positive, respectful relationships across systems with youth and family members, and recognizing and appreciating the value of differing perspectives and accountability to achieve a shared vision. 18 CDSS The Integrated Core Practice Model (ICPM) Resource, The Integrated Core Practice Model (ca.gov)\n\nPage 17\n\n# Continuum of Care Reform\n\nIn 2015, the Continuum of Care Reform (CCR), (Assembly Bill 403 (Chapter 773, Statutes 2015), provided the statutory framework to ensure services and supports are focused on maintaining stability for foster youth in a permanent home, and reducing the use of congregate care facilities. 19 To achieve these outcomes, the CDSS has implemented a number of reforms, including the expanded use of Child and Family Teams (CFTs) to develop family-driven, child-focused case plans and promote access and availability of services and support for home-based family care settings. The teaming model, a key component of the ICPM, can and should be extended to also support activities that prevent out-of-home care in the first place. # System of Care Reform (AB 2083)\n\nBuilding on the ICPM, California enacted Assembly Bill 2083 (Chapter 815, Statutes 2018) to guide county and state interagency coordination for children and youth in foster care.",

An equity lens prescribes that family experiences and perceptions are a key data source for driving program design, and that qualitative data are equally valued as quantitative data. The CDSS has created intentional and targeted engagement with youth and parents to gather feedback on the Five-Year State Prevention Plan and will continue to engage these individuals and communities in a culturally appropriate way throughout implementation.",

The Title IV-E Prevention Program established by FFPSA will complement California\u2019s existing capacity to further the safety and permanency of children and youth who are brought to the attention of community partners, Tribes, child welfare, or probation agencies. The Title IV-E Prevention Program provides a valuable opportunity to serve children, youth, parents, and caregivers, as well as expectant and parenting foster youth, to promote access to other prevention services and programs, and as such, may have a high need for immediate supports and services to prevent entry into the foster care system. California intends to use Title IV-E prevention funding, alongside other available funding streams, and coupled with other parallel reforms, to continue to build a comprehensive system of care which emphasizes prevention and early intervention services. In recent years, the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) has significantly increased the visibility and urgency around establishing a continuum of prevention services and supports throughout California. In partnership with CDSS, county child welfare agencies created the Child and Family Enrichment Cabinet in 2018, which currently supports 24 cross-sector collaborative prevention planning teams in developing and implementing local prevention plans. The Cabinet is comprised of ten county child welfare directors, all of whom are champions for expanding prevention. The Cabinet\u2019s mission is to inspire and support each California county to develop an integrated system of care that supports families in providing (or providing return to) safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments for their children. This integrated system\u2019s primary aim is keeping children safe at home by strengthening families through programs such as CalFRESH,\u00b2 California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) Homeless Assistance,\u00b3 CalWORKs Home Visiting,\u2074 and Differential Response.\u2075 California plans to leverage these existing prevention planning efforts to embed FFPSA-funded prevention services into a comprehensive local prevention continuum. 1.

Risk Assessment is used after the safety assessment, in the closing of all referrals and in the opening or closing of child welfare cases. - SDM\u00ae Risk Reassessment: The SDM\u00ae Risk Reassessment is completed on all open cases in which all children remain in the home, or cases in which all children have been returned home and family maintenance services will be provided. This assessment provides the ability to see if the family has made significant progress towards the case plan goal and/or to assess the level of change to the original level of risk determined in the SDM Risk Assessment. # Probation Departments\n\nProbation departments use a variety of assessment tools in order to ensure ongoing monitoring of safety and risk. The Juvenile Assessment Intervention System (JAIS), Positive Achievement Change Tool (PACT), Youth Level of Service/Case Management Instrument (YLS/CMI), and the Risk Resiliency Check Up Tool (RRC) all include domains that assess for safety and risk. Currently in California, probation officers conduct assessments to determine traditional candidacy for foster care using the \u201cEvaluation of Imminent Risk and Reasonable Candidacy\u201d (EIRRC) tool. The EIRRC tool is a checklist that assists in accurately identifying why and how a child is considered a candidate. If the child is clearly identified as a candidate, then a Case Plan must be developed, and the following elements must be documented:\n\n- Description of circumstances: including but not limited to behavioral issues that place the child or youth at imminent risk of removal from the home absent the indicated services. This cannot be solely a list of problems but must include why these issues will result in out-of-home placement if services are not provided. This will include behavioral issues and obstacles related to the parents or guardian. - Types of services needed: for the child or youth to remain safely in his/her home. This must include any services aimed at the parents or guardians. - Statement regarding foster care: that absents the effectiveness of services, foster care is the planned arrangement for the child or youth and identify the type of planned placement setting. For those probation departments who do not opt into providing Title IV-E prevention services, they will continue to use this assessment tool to track traditional candidacy for juvenile justice youth.",

California recognizes that families are complex and dynamic, therefore assessments must view the family history in context with current circumstances to best understand their needs. For example, a family may have risk factors such as an historical mental health or substance use diagnosis, but the current circumstance of a hospitalization or substance use relapse may place the child or youth at imminent risk of removal and foster care placement. In these situations, when there is a recommendation that a prevention service may provide supports and interventions that mitigate such safety threats, a determination of candidacy can be made. Other examples of imminent circumstances may include but are not limited to:\n\n- Current or recent (within 6 months) family involvement with social services agency\n- Change in family relationships characterized by frequent conflict or violence;\n- Recent increase in substance use that impacts daily functioning and ability to care for the child or youth;\n- Recent incident in which a parent or guardian made a plausible threat to cause serious physical harm to a child or youth;\n- Incarceration of the caregiver;\n- Child or youth participated in criminal activity; and\n- Other recent or current circumstance that may cause family instability or a threat to the child/youth\u2019s safety or well-being.

Biases or cultural misunderstandings and distrust between child welfare decision makers and families also contribute to children\u2019s and youth\u2019s removal from their homes into foster care.11\n\nWith this understanding in mind, the State and local governments are relying more on the help of community partners to implement culturally responsive community programs and services that can better serve Black families and communities. Economic marginalization and disproportionate levels of poverty also increase Black families\u2019 exposure to the child welfare system. Black households experience homelessness at a disproportionate rate relative to the general population. Families living in poverty have more difficulties accessing the housing, behavioral health and health services, and other resources required to keep families stable and children and youth safely at home.

California has taken, and will continue to take, steps to improve and increase relevant trainings, such as cultural humility and implicit bias trainings, within child welfare agencies to reduce racial biases. In 2010, the CDSS received a federal grant to create the California Partners for Permanency Project (CAPP). The CAPP\u2019s goal was to improve permanency outcomes for all children and reduce disparities in permanency outcomes for African American and American Indian children in or entering Long Term Foster Care (LTFC). The CAPP implemented a Child and Family Practice Model (a precursor to the Integrated Core Practice Model now being used) that included culturally appropriate engagement; empowerment of family, tribal, and community networks; and use of culturally appropriate healing practices and practice adaptations.\u00b9\u00b3\n\nThe CAPP promoted strategies such as (1) ensuring the system becomes aware of, and more sensitively interprets, the cultural values and traditions of families being served as strengths; and (2) ensuring access to, and supporting use of, well-being and healing practices that are relevant and meaningful to the family and its culture. While these strategies were important in improving responsiveness to culture and trauma, CAPP also found that California\u2019s child welfare systems needed to be changed. Through the CAPP work, the CDSS discovered that in order to provide some of the more culturally appropriate supports that are needed for families to heal, the child welfare system must first develop or adapt internal business processes and fiscal mechanisms to effectively host and integrate those supports and services. Another important lesson learned from the CAPP Project is the level of investment needed for a sufficient, stable, trained, and well-coached workforce that can effectively deliver evidence-based or evidence-informed practices with fidelity. Without fidelity to the model, the child and family outcomes promised are unlikely to manifest.",

Following consultation with counties, Tribes, and community-based organizations, as well as those with lived experience, California has determined that if a child falls within one of the categories specified below, the child can be considered for eligibility for Title IV-E prevention services. While the groups described below are at increased risk of foster care, a case-by-case, individualized assessment will be required to determine whether an individual child within that category meets the criteria of being at imminent risk of entering foster care. The following children are currently considered candidates for foster care under the existing Title IV-E foster care program and may be eligible for prevention services under Title IV-E based upon an individual assessment and determination that the child is at imminent risk of entering foster care but can remain safely in the home as long as allowable mental health, substance use, and/or in-home parent skill-based program services are provided.
