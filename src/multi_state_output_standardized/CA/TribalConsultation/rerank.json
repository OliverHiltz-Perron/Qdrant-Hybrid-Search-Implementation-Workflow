To improve consultation efforts with Tribes, the CDSS instituted the Tribal Consultation Policy (TCP) in 2017 to guide consultations between the CDSS and the 109 federally recognized Tribes in California on policies and procedures that affect Tribes. The Five-Year State Prevention Plan\u2019s review adhered to the 2017 TCP. These recent changes within the CDSS have supported the State\u2019s efforts to build on prior work engaging communities and increasing partnerships with BIPOC, Tribes, and immigrant communities, as well as supporting the additional work that is necessary to strengthen equity within CDSS programs. These structures will also support the equity efforts for implementation of Title IV-E prevention services under FFPSA. Page 12\n\n# Cultivate and Maintain Meaningful Relationships with Tribes\n\nWith 109 federally recognized Tribes in California and 78 entities petitioning to be recognized, within California is the United States\u2019 largest AI/AN population. The United States and California\u2019s history of actions, laws and policies discriminating against American Indian/Alaska native\u2019s and denying the existence of tribal sovereignty has long lasting impacts causing trauma today. The detrimental impact of these actions on tribal children and families is evident in the overrepresentation of American Indian and Alaska native children in the child welfare system and in foster care. California recognizes the significant work that must be done to address the impacts of systemic and historical trauma and is committed to working with Tribes to address these impacts and create healing opportunities. The CDSS is especially committed to improving the outcomes of AI/AN children, youth, and families. The CDSS has Title IV-E Agreements with the Yurok and Karuk Tribes that support partnering in government-to-government relationships aiming to support Tribes\u2019 control over programs and services that assist AI/AN children and families. Over the last several years, the CDSS has ramped up efforts to improve relationships with Tribes by ensuring that the needs of AI/AN families are consistently at the forefront of policy development. This is demonstrated by the following:\n\n- Establishing the Tribal Advisory Council (TAC) as a primary strategy to engage Tribes and tribal partners in CDSS initiatives.",

Since the spring of 2019, the CDSS convened multiple stakeholder workgroups, including a widely attended Prevention Summit, designed to orient stakeholders, and gauge their needs and readiness to implement prevention services. The CDSS sought feedback through a detailed survey process, as well as through focused conversations with Child Welfare Directors, Chief Probation Officers, youth and parents with lived experience, service providers, and training academies. The CDSS will continue to reach out to varied partners and stakeholders as the Title IV-E Prevention Program is implemented. In addition, the CDSS has committed to an annual planning update process in collaboration with counties and stakeholders, and in consultation with Tribes. At that time, program enhancements such as adding EBPs or modifying candidacy populations may be considered. Page 20\n\n# Tribal Consultation\n\nThroughout the development of the prevention plan, the CDSS regularly engaged Tribes by requesting and engaging in formal government to government Tribal Consultations and through engagement of the Tribal Advisory Committee to solicit input on the development of the Title IV-E Prevention Program. The Tribal Advisory Committee convened in the fall/winter of 2021, where CDSS presented feedback on the state plan to respond to the Children\u2019s Bureau feedback and assisted drafting the most recent version of the Plan. # CHILD AND FAMILY ELIGIBILITY\n\n# CANDIDATES FOR FOSTER CARE\n\nThe FFPSA defines a candidate for foster care as a child who is identified in a prevention plan as being at imminent risk of entering foster care, but who can remain safely in the child\u2019s home or in a kinship placement if eligible prevention services that are necessary to prevent the entry of the child into foster care are provided. The CDSS has analyzed historical data from 2016-2019 and collaborated with various stakeholders to identify methods for determining which children and families are eligible for referral for Title IV-E prevention services under FFPSA. California recognizes that while categories of children and families eligible for prevention services can be identified and referred, actual \u201cimminent risk\u201d of foster care entry and candidacy can only be determined on a case-by-case basis, with thoughtful consideration for each child and change family\u2019s unique needs and circumstances, and with use of an unbiased process and/or tools to assess risk.",

An integrated system must develop a cross-collaborative network of support that meets the needs of families at every prevention level. Families\u2019 needs are diverse and cannot be addressed by any one profession or service system; those needs span public and private systems and agencies including child welfare, behavioral health, healthcare, public health, maternal and child health, education, housing and juvenile probation agencies, juvenile courts, the Child Abuse Prevention Council, First 5, childcare, and system partners. Only with programming that reaches across professions and service sectors, can California create comprehensive approaches to meeting these needs and promoting child and family well-being.",

California is committed to meeting the unique needs of AI/AN children and families by ensuring that services are provided in a manner consistent with the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (25 U.S.C.

When a family provides information during an initial intake assessment by local service provider that there is a \u2018reason to know\u2019 a child is an Indian child, as described in WIC Section 224.2(d) the information must be shared with the Tribe so that the Tribe has an opportunity to participate in the family assessment, case planning, service delivery, and any safety and risk assessments. Local Title IV-E agencies must also partner with Tribes to ensure that culturally appropriate services are available at the local level to meet the needs of Indian children and families who are served through the community pathway. # CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE PROGRAMMING\n\nThe CDSS recognizes the need to identify culturally appropriate services for evaluation and inclusion both in the state\u2019s prevention plan and the Title IV-E Prevention Clearinghouse before they can be implemented locally and eligible for Title IV-E reimbursement. The CDSS will encourage and support local Title IV-E agencies to implement available cultural adaptations to services that meet the cultural needs of diverse groups, particularly those disproportionately represented in the child welfare system including tribal families. In addition, jurisdictions participating in the state\u2019s Family First Prevention Services Program will be able to supplement Title IV-E prevention services with culturally appropriate programs not yet eligible for Title IV-E reimbursement using additional funds that are provided to those counties who opt in. Funding from other sources supporting prevention activities can be leveraged to accomplish these goals, including use of state funds through the Family First Prevention Program state block grant. These funds can also be used to contract directly with Tribes to build service capacity and/or provide services to their members. # CALIFORNIA TRIBES WITH A TITLE IV-E AGREEMENT WITH CDSS\n\nTribes that have a Title IV-E agreement with the State pursuant to WIC Sections 10553.1 and WIC Sections 16000.6 to operate, independent of counties, a Title IV-E program may opt to directly provide Title IV-E prevention services.",

The System of Care reforms also required the establishment of a Children and Youth System of Care State Technical Assistance (TA) Team. The teams consist of representatives from California Health and Human Services (CHHS) Agency, the CDSS, the Department of Health Care Services, Department of Developmental Services, the California Department of Education, along with assistance from the Department of Rehabilitation as needed. Additionally, the Children and Youth System of Care State Team will continue partnership with the CDSS\u2019 Office of Tribal Affairs to appropriately seek consultation with Tribes.

In California, the Regional Training Academies (RTAs) provide a continuum of training and professional educational opportunities for child welfare and Title IV-E Tribal staff through the State. This structure currently includes regional delivery of foundational and ad hoc trainings through five RTAs with curricula coordinated by the California Social Work Education Center (CalSWEC). Additional training resources also include the Center for Human Services at University of California at Davis Extension, the Resource Center for Family-Focused Practice (RCFFP) which focuses on family centered practice, Tribal STAR at San Diego State University Academy for Professional Excellence, which provides training and technical assistance (TA) to child welfare social workers, legal advocates, Tribal Nations and Tribal Social Service agencies in 5 Southern California counties, CalTrin and Strategies TA, which provides trainings to local service providers including Family Resource Center and community-based agency staff, and the Chief Probation Officers of California which develops and delivers foundational, supervisory and ad hoc training on child welfare practices to their members. California will leverage current training in place that have topics related to ensuring successful delivery of Family First Prevention Services. Core curriculum for child welfare staff, known as Common Core, already consists of a combination of classroom and field training on topics such as:\n\n- Trauma-informed practice\n- Integrated Core Practice Model (ICPM)\n- Tribal Engagement, ICWA including Active Efforts and culturally appropriate programs\n- Equity & cultural humility\n- Engaging children & families\n- Case planning with families and county partners\n- Conducting risk assessments, including use of assessment tools\n\nPage 46\n\n# Monitoring child safety\n\n- Key issues in child welfare, including behavioral health, substance use disorders, and intimate partner violence\n- Data systems & reporting\n\nThe RTAs are currently able to track workforce training and conduct evaluations of child welfare staff through pre-and post-surveys using an online learning and management system. Local agencies are provided access to this system, so tracking and evaluation of workforce development can be expanded to include probation, Tribes, and community pathway partners.",

Ultimately, the ten (10) EBPs chosen are all well-supported EBPs in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse and listed in Appendix A. For each of these EBPs, California is requesting a waiver of the evaluation requirement due to the compelling effectiveness of the practices and adherence to continuous quality improvement processes included in the design. Because not all services requested by stakeholders were able to be included in the current Prevention Plan, CDSS may support additional prevention services and programs for evaluation in the future, including those which are rated as \u201csupported\u201d or \u201cpromising\u201d but lack sufficient evidence to be rated in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse as \u201cwell supported\u201d. During an annual planning process, the CDSS will consult with opt-in agencies to identify additional programs and services that align with the statewide prevention strategy, have demonstrated outcomes with specified target populations, and have the potential to meet the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse criteria.
