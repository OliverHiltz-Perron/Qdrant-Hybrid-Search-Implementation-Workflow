The Five-Year State Prevention Plan\u2019s review adhered to the 2017 TCP. The CDSS established the Tribal Advisory Council (TAC) as a primary strategy to engage Tribes and tribal partners in CDSS initiatives. The Tribal Advisory Committee was engaged to solicit input and convened in fall/winter 2021. CDSS entered consultation with the Yurok and Karuk Tribes to determine how the IV-E prevention program will be incorporated into their existing Title IV-E agreements.",
