The cultural relevance of EBPs has been raised as a concern by stakeholders. To meet model fidelity standards, support is available for providers of EBPs from program developers who can assist with creative solutions to accommodate the needs of diverse populations. Accommodations can be made to the well-supported EBPs for cultural appropriateness with guidance from EBP providers to ensure model fidelity standards are maintained. California intends to use Motivational Interviewing (MI) as a cross-cutting case management intervention beyond its application to substance use disorder treatment and has requested the waiver for evaluation aspect. Motivational Interviewing has shown considerable success as an application to service interventions including in-home parenting skill-building, mental health treatment, and family engagement and interaction. Motivational Interviewing may be applied in a variety of settings such as community agency and clinical settings as a stand-alone EBP intervention or in parallel with other EBPs providing those EBPs are being delivered with model fidelity.",

With the expiration of the Title IV-E waivers, FFPSA\u2019s authorization to use Title IV-E funds for prevention services stands to positively impact ongoing efforts to build a robust prevention continuum. Using Title IV-E funds will allow for service delivery to traditionally underserved populations and expand evidence-based practices to prevent child harm, especially the harm caused by trauma associated with detention and foster care. Below are the strategies California currently employs at each level of prevention, with those most impacted by FFPSA. # Primary Prevention\n\nPrevention at the primary level addresses general population needs and child well-being through a social determinants of health approach. Although Title IV-E funding may be unavailable to support primary prevention, California will continue to develop and fund primary prevention strategies with the following objectives:\n\n- Increasing access to supports such as childcare, food and housing;\n- Reducing poverty and improving economic stability;\n- Improving school readiness;\n- Improving transportation;\n- Increasing social connections within families and within the community;\n- Reducing substance use;\n- Improving access to healthcare;\n- Improving neighborhood safety and play areas for children and youth;\n- Increasing public awareness through engagement, education, and outreach;\n- Improving maternal health; and\n- Improving paternal engagement. For child welfare or probation agencies (hereinafter \u201clocal Title IV-E agencies\u201d) and Tribes with a Title IV-E agreement with the State who opt-in, Title IV-E prevention funding can enhance secondary and tertiary prevention services. # Secondary Prevention\n\nPrevention at the secondary level involves providing and evaluating direct services that develop and amplify protective factors and are provided to families objectively assessed to be at risk of child abuse or neglect.",

Several rural and smaller jurisdictions still struggle to garner the resources to deploy EBPs at scale. Many EBPs are currently being delivered through braided funding from a variety of sources, such as Medi-Cal, the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), CalWORKs, and local sources such as First 5. This section describes California\u2019s strategies for the initial selection of EBPs to launch the implementation of the Title IV-E Prevention Program established by the FFPSA. The CDSS reviewed several criteria to select EBPs for California\u2019s population the target population to include in the prevention state service array, including:\n\n- the extent to which the EBP was currently being implemented in California,\n- the qualifications of those who would be delivering the EBP,\n- the eligibility requirements of the EBP,\n- whether the EBP was effective at serving BIPOC children and families,\n- the amount of support provided by the purveyor of the EBP and\n- whether or not the EBP required an evaluation.

The Title IV-E Prevention Program established by FFPSA will complement California\u2019s existing capacity to further the safety and permanency of children and youth who are brought to the attention of community partners, Tribes, child welfare, or probation agencies. The Title IV-E Prevention Program provides a valuable opportunity to serve children, youth, parents, and caregivers, as well as expectant and parenting foster youth, to promote access to other prevention services and programs, and as such, may have a high need for immediate supports and services to prevent entry into the foster care system. California intends to use Title IV-E prevention funding, alongside other available funding streams, and coupled with other parallel reforms, to continue to build a comprehensive system of care which emphasizes prevention and early intervention services. In recent years, the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) has significantly increased the visibility and urgency around establishing a continuum of prevention services and supports throughout California. In partnership with CDSS, county child welfare agencies created the Child and Family Enrichment Cabinet in 2018, which currently supports 24 cross-sector collaborative prevention planning teams in developing and implementing local prevention plans. The Cabinet is comprised of ten county child welfare directors, all of whom are champions for expanding prevention. The Cabinet\u2019s mission is to inspire and support each California county to develop an integrated system of care that supports families in providing (or providing return to) safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments for their children. This integrated system\u2019s primary aim is keeping children safe at home by strengthening families through programs such as CalFRESH,\u00b2 California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) Homeless Assistance,\u00b3 CalWORKs Home Visiting,\u2074 and Differential Response.\u2075 California plans to leverage these existing prevention planning efforts to embed FFPSA-funded prevention services into a comprehensive local prevention continuum. 1.

Title IV-B, Subpart 2 funds support case worker visits, kinship navigator programs, and family services and supports under the PSSF program. The CDSS will inform and educate the local Title IV-E Agencies on how the services within these programs may overlap. Local Title IV-E agencies are required to complete an assessment to determine how to best spend their PSSF funds. During this process the CDSS will encourage the local Title IV-E agencies to select a mix of programs in their CPP including those which are not funded by Title IV-E.

For a large state that is state-supervised and county-administered, with 58 local Title IV-E agencies to serve, devising a training system that adequately addresses needs statewide requires thoughtful planning, rigorous standards, and built-in flexibility. California\u2019s 58 county child welfare services programs range from rural to highly urbanized, with workforces ranging from just a few workers to a staff of thousands. Training sophistication ranges from informal grass-roots workforce development efforts to highly developed training departments with complex learning management systems.",

Contiguous 12-month periods of services can be provided as long as the youth is assessed to have a continued need for the services. # PATHWAYS TO PREVENTION SERVICES\n\nCalifornia will provide local Title IV-E agencies the opportunity to utilize the following pathways to identify, assess and support a child or family with Title IV-E-funded prevention services. The pathways represent the ways in which vulnerable children and families may come to the attention of service providers and be approved for Title IV-E prevention services. The Family First Prevention Services Act requires collection of data to model fidelity and CQI activities involved in the prevention services. All the required FFPSA claiming data elements can be found in the Children\u2019s Bureau (August 19, 2019) Technical Bulletin #1 (REVISED): Title IV-E Prevention Program Data Elements.34 For each of the pathways below, this information will be collected in the CWS-CARES. # TITLE IV-E AGENCY PATHWAY\n\n# CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES\n\nThe Child Welfare Pathway for Title IV-E prevention services allows local child welfare agencies that are interfacing with children and families to identify, assess and support families with prevention services directly. A Child Abuse Hotline is one access point of the Child Welfare Pathway for Title IV-E funded prevention services. When the referral from the Hotline is assigned to an emergency response social worker, they contact the family to investigate the allegation(s). If the investigation results in substantiated or inconclusive findings, yet a case is not opened, a child may be identified as a\n\n34 Children\u2019s Bureau, Title IV-E Prevention Program Data Elements (June 30, 2022)\n\nPage 27\nCandidate for foster care eligible for Title IV-E Prevention Services and referred to available and appropriate prevention services under the community pathway described below. When direct involvement with the family by the local Title IV-E agency is necessary, Family Maintenance (FM) is another avenue through which families are eligible to receive voluntary or court ordered services to prevent removal of children from their homes. The FM services may occur to prevent entry into care and may be provided after reunification to prevent reentry. The FFPSA provides an opportunity for child welfare agencies to develop or expand capacity of the prevention services delivered under FM.",

The local Title IV-E agency\u2019s role is peripheral, and its purpose is to be the authorizing entity for Title IV-E funded prevention services that determines eligibility and maintains responsibility for supervising the Title IV-E funded activities performed by the contracted community agency. Developing a community pathway is critical to an equity-centered approach to Title IV-E prevention as studies have demonstrated that \u201cracial disparities occur at various decision points in the child welfare continuum\u201d15. California\u2019s vision for prevention includes a community pathway for families to access services prior to a call being made to the child abuse hotline and for families to access services through community-based organizations when direct involvement with the local Title IV-E agency is unnecessary. Elevating the role of CBOs and FRCs as points of access for prevention services reinforces California\u2019s commitment to the vision of a true prevention continuum. # Cultural Adaptations of Evidence Based Practices (EBPs)\n\n\u201cEvidence-Based Practice\u201d is an approach to prevention or treatment that is backed by documented scientific evidence demonstrating positive outcomes in multiple research studies. Evidence can be obtained through a variety of methods such as randomized clinical trials, experimental studies, or meta-analyses16. The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) defines an EBP as an \u201cintervention which has been consistently shown in several research studies to assist consumers in achieving their desired goals of health and wellness\u201d17. Well-supported EBPs have met or exceeded a standard of sufficient evidence existing to make claims of positive outcomes for specified populations of consumers. Even well-supported EBPs may need to be modified in the future as they expand and evolve to serve the diverse cultural needs of California\u2019s families. These modifications will be planned for, encouraged, and resourced as part of FFPSA implementation.

Children who were removed due to parental drug use are less likely to reunify and more likely to have reoccurrence of maltreatment.\u00b2\u2079 Title IV-E funded prevention services can support parents in accessing substance use treatment and develop parenting skills to help to reduce the effects of parental substance use disorders on their children. - Children or youth experiencing other risk factors that when combined with family instability or safety threats would be assessed to be at imminent risk of foster care.",

An integrated system must develop a cross-collaborative network of support that meets the needs of families at every prevention level. Families\u2019 needs are diverse and cannot be addressed by any one profession or service system; those needs span public and private systems and agencies including child welfare, behavioral health, healthcare, public health, maternal and child health, education, housing and juvenile probation agencies, juvenile courts, the Child Abuse Prevention Council, First 5, childcare, and system partners. Only with programming that reaches across professions and service sectors, can California create comprehensive approaches to meeting these needs and promoting child and family well-being.",

The CDSS envisions \u201cAn integrated state-wide system that supports families to provide safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments for their children and youth\u201d.6\n\nThis vision involves a system of care supported by a framework for prevention that includes primary, secondary, and tertiary strategies, grounded in principles of fairness and equity. # THEORY OF CHANGE:\n\nIF California shapes policy and practice to promote the safety and well-being of its children, youth, and families, THEN California\u2019s prevention partners and family strengthening agencies can:\n\n- Promote child and family safety and well-being by strengthening the capacity within communities to care for one another:\n- Work effectively together as a network of support; and\n- Leverage resources to enhance impact.

This information will be documented in the CWS-CARES. This automated system will be used to capture the necessary data to ensure the service delivery of the program meets model fidelity standards. # CQI AND GOVERNANCE\n\nThe CDSS will also leverage contracted expertise to develop the program\u2019s CQI framework. This framework will ensure that the state\u2019s Title IV-E Program is equipped with the structures, policies, and procedures necessary to connect efforts between the state and local level to ensure that program data is analyzed to inform program changes. The CDSS has created the governance structure (figure 2. below) to oversee and guide the implementation of the Title IV-E Program. The governance structure leverages existing California government entities including the California Health and Human Services (CHHS), which oversees both CDSS and its partner agency the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), existing relationships with the California Legislature, and the Department of Finance to provide oversight, direction, and culture of the program, and to determine state resources. The structure also depicts the critical relationships with local Title IV-E agencies, tribal governments, service providers, those with lived experiences, which are engaged for planning, implementing, and evaluating the program.",
