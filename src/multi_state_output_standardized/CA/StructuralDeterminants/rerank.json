With the expiration of the Title IV-E waivers, FFPSA\u2019s authorization to use Title IV-E funds for prevention services stands to positively impact ongoing efforts to build a robust prevention continuum. Using Title IV-E funds will allow for service delivery to traditionally underserved populations and expand evidence-based practices to prevent child harm, especially the harm caused by trauma associated with detention and foster care. Below are the strategies California currently employs at each level of prevention, with those most impacted by FFPSA. # Primary Prevention\n\nPrevention at the primary level addresses general population needs and child well-being through a social determinants of health approach. Although Title IV-E funding may be unavailable to support primary prevention, California will continue to develop and fund primary prevention strategies with the following objectives:\n\n- Increasing access to supports such as childcare, food and housing;\n- Reducing poverty and improving economic stability;\n- Improving school readiness;\n- Improving transportation;\n- Increasing social connections within families and within the community;\n- Reducing substance use;\n- Improving access to healthcare;\n- Improving neighborhood safety and play areas for children and youth;\n- Increasing public awareness through engagement, education, and outreach;\n- Improving maternal health; and\n- Improving paternal engagement. For child welfare or probation agencies (hereinafter \u201clocal Title IV-E agencies\u201d) and Tribes with a Title IV-E agreement with the State who opt-in, Title IV-E prevention funding can enhance secondary and tertiary prevention services. # Secondary Prevention\n\nPrevention at the secondary level involves providing and evaluating direct services that develop and amplify protective factors and are provided to families objectively assessed to be at risk of child abuse or neglect.",

The Title IV-E Prevention Program established by FFPSA will complement California\u2019s existing capacity to further the safety and permanency of children and youth who are brought to the attention of community partners, Tribes, child welfare, or probation agencies. The Title IV-E Prevention Program provides a valuable opportunity to serve children, youth, parents, and caregivers, as well as expectant and parenting foster youth, to promote access to other prevention services and programs, and as such, may have a high need for immediate supports and services to prevent entry into the foster care system. California intends to use Title IV-E prevention funding, alongside other available funding streams, and coupled with other parallel reforms, to continue to build a comprehensive system of care which emphasizes prevention and early intervention services. In recent years, the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) has significantly increased the visibility and urgency around establishing a continuum of prevention services and supports throughout California. In partnership with CDSS, county child welfare agencies created the Child and Family Enrichment Cabinet in 2018, which currently supports 24 cross-sector collaborative prevention planning teams in developing and implementing local prevention plans. The Cabinet is comprised of ten county child welfare directors, all of whom are champions for expanding prevention. The Cabinet\u2019s mission is to inspire and support each California county to develop an integrated system of care that supports families in providing (or providing return to) safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments for their children. This integrated system\u2019s primary aim is keeping children safe at home by strengthening families through programs such as CalFRESH,\u00b2 California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) Homeless Assistance,\u00b3 CalWORKs Home Visiting,\u2074 and Differential Response.\u2075 California plans to leverage these existing prevention planning efforts to embed FFPSA-funded prevention services into a comprehensive local prevention continuum. 1.

California has taken, and will continue to take, steps to improve and increase relevant trainings, such as cultural humility and implicit bias trainings, within child welfare agencies to reduce racial biases. In 2010, the CDSS received a federal grant to create the California Partners for Permanency Project (CAPP). The CAPP\u2019s goal was to improve permanency outcomes for all children and reduce disparities in permanency outcomes for African American and American Indian children in or entering Long Term Foster Care (LTFC). The CAPP implemented a Child and Family Practice Model (a precursor to the Integrated Core Practice Model now being used) that included culturally appropriate engagement; empowerment of family, tribal, and community networks; and use of culturally appropriate healing practices and practice adaptations.\u00b9\u00b3\n\nThe CAPP promoted strategies such as (1) ensuring the system becomes aware of, and more sensitively interprets, the cultural values and traditions of families being served as strengths; and (2) ensuring access to, and supporting use of, well-being and healing practices that are relevant and meaningful to the family and its culture. While these strategies were important in improving responsiveness to culture and trauma, CAPP also found that California\u2019s child welfare systems needed to be changed. Through the CAPP work, the CDSS discovered that in order to provide some of the more culturally appropriate supports that are needed for families to heal, the child welfare system must first develop or adapt internal business processes and fiscal mechanisms to effectively host and integrate those supports and services. Another important lesson learned from the CAPP Project is the level of investment needed for a sufficient, stable, trained, and well-coached workforce that can effectively deliver evidence-based or evidence-informed practices with fidelity. Without fidelity to the model, the child and family outcomes promised are unlikely to manifest.",

The CDSS envisions \u201cAn integrated state-wide system that supports families to provide safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments for their children and youth\u201d.6\n\nThis vision involves a system of care supported by a framework for prevention that includes primary, secondary, and tertiary strategies, grounded in principles of fairness and equity. # THEORY OF CHANGE:\n\nIF California shapes policy and practice to promote the safety and well-being of its children, youth, and families, THEN California\u2019s prevention partners and family strengthening agencies can:\n\n- Promote child and family safety and well-being by strengthening the capacity within communities to care for one another:\n- Work effectively together as a network of support; and\n- Leverage resources to enhance impact.

This data (depicted in Appendix B) show that Black and AI/AN children and youth are disproportionately more likely to be involved in the child welfare system, to be the subject of child maltreatment allegations, and to be placed in foster care. Black and AI/AN children and youth disproportionately yield high abuse and neglect substantiation rates, as well as higher rates of entry and re-entry to foster care, while AI/AN and Asian/Pacific Islander children have a higher rate of short stays in foster care. Furthermore, poverty (economic inequity) and structural racism are contributing factors to these disproportionalities and disparities. While the following section focuses on systemic data regarding Black and AI/AN, many of the same inequities contribute to adverse outcomes for Latino families and families with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ+) children or youth. California fully intends to develop a Title IV-E Prevention Program whose service array contains evidence-based practices (EBPs) which have proven success with historically underserved racial and ethnic groups or can be adaptable to meet cultural needs when identified.

The CDSS also considers teaming models (e.g., child and family teams, family team decision making) to be a strategy that, if deployed correctly, centers the lived experience of families in crisis and leverages families\u2019 inherent strengths and resilience to remediate the crisis. Together, teams create exponential energy and connect families to resources to meet the family\u2019s needs and support their success. In a complex service system like California, work product is created through a series of business processes which support the mission of the organization, county systems, and provider contractors. Healing from trauma and connecting youth to their natural and community supports can be challenging in government-operated systems.

Accommodations can be made to the well-supported EBPs for cultural appropriateness with guidance from EBP providers to ensure model fidelity standards are maintained. California intends to use Motivational Interviewing (MI) as a cross-cutting case management intervention beyond its application to substance use disorder treatment and has requested the waiver for evaluation aspect.

The ICWA compliance is the focus of this effort.

Historically, rural local Title IV-E agencies have fewer local funding resources to draw upon, and struggle to meet the needs of their Tribal families. While Tribes have established culturally appropriate services to meet their members\u2019 needs, limited funding has typically been available through child welfare agencies. The availability of Title IV-E prevention services will help to address these resource deficits. # Address the Systemic Disparities Black Families Face in Child Welfare Programs\n\nThe significant histories of systemic racism in society and in government actions have also had lasting impacts within California\u2019s child welfare programs on Black children and families.",

The local Title IV-E agency\u2019s role is peripheral, and its purpose is to be the authorizing entity for Title IV-E funded prevention services that determines eligibility and maintains responsibility for supervising the Title IV-E funded activities performed by the contracted community agency. Developing a community pathway is critical to an equity-centered approach to Title IV-E prevention as studies have demonstrated that \u201cracial disparities occur at various decision points in the child welfare continuum\u201d15. California\u2019s vision for prevention includes a community pathway for families to access services prior to a call being made to the child abuse hotline and for families to access services through community-based organizations when direct involvement with the local Title IV-E agency is unnecessary. Elevating the role of CBOs and FRCs as points of access for prevention services reinforces California\u2019s commitment to the vision of a true prevention continuum. # Cultural Adaptations of Evidence Based Practices (EBPs)\n\n\u201cEvidence-Based Practice\u201d is an approach to prevention or treatment that is backed by documented scientific evidence demonstrating positive outcomes in multiple research studies. Evidence can be obtained through a variety of methods such as randomized clinical trials, experimental studies, or meta-analyses16. The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) defines an EBP as an \u201cintervention which has been consistently shown in several research studies to assist consumers in achieving their desired goals of health and wellness\u201d17. Well-supported EBPs have met or exceeded a standard of sufficient evidence existing to make claims of positive outcomes for specified populations of consumers. Even well-supported EBPs may need to be modified in the future as they expand and evolve to serve the diverse cultural needs of California\u2019s families. These modifications will be planned for, encouraged, and resourced as part of FFPSA implementation.

For children and families receiving prevention services through the Title IV-E agency pathway, standard protocols for assessment such as the use of the Structured Decision Making (SDM) tools and monthly visits by the social worker will remain.

Updates to the family\u2019s prevention plan, including engagement efforts, ongoing safety and risk monitoring including home visits, case plan content and SDM assessments, will be documented in CWS-CARES. Per existing state regulations contained in Division 31-320 of the Child Welfare Services Manual of Policies and Procedures (MPP), requirements during social worker contacts with the child and family include ongoing monitoring of physical and emotional condition as well as adherence to the case plan including documentation of the progress towards the established goals. Child welfare social workers are required to conduct visits at least three times in the first 30 calendar days. After the initial 30 days, a visit must be conducted at least once every thirty days for ongoing safety and risk monitoring, and the majority of the visits must occur in the home. In 2007, California implemented the use of a Standardized Safety Assessment System, Structured Decision Making (SDM) across all 58 counties in California.

The California Title IV-E Prevention Program will function alongside other prevention programs and funds, such as Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) funding, FRCs, and contracts with, or grants to, CBOs, all acting in concert in order to move the gravitational center of child and family serving systems upstream. Within this framework, local Title IV-E Agencies can provide a complete and comprehensive array of services to meet the needs of children and families across the entire continuum of care. Prevention services provided for children and parents, or caregivers will be coordinated with services provided under Subparts 1 and 2 of Title IV-B of the Social Security Act. Title IV-B, Subpart 1 funds are primarily used for child welfare caseworker services. In this capacity, these funds support essential caseworker activities with children and families. Title IV-B, Subpart 2 funds support case worker visits, kinship navigator programs, and family services and supports under the PSSF program. The CDSS will inform and educate the local Title IV-E Agencies on how the services within these programs may overlap. Local Title IV-E agencies are required to complete an assessment to determine how to best spend their PSSF funds. During this process the CDSS will encourage the local Title IV-E agencies to select a mix of programs in their CPP including those which are not funded by Title IV-E. The CDSS is committed to programs and processes that complement each other and serve the overall purpose of creating a robust service array that creates and supports a full system of care for children, youth, and families.",

Local Title IV-E agencies have also been encouraged to align their FFPS program with their System of Care (AB 2083) framework to include comprehensive prevention. For California, given the state\u2019s history with prevention, Title IV-E prevention services under Part I of FFPSA are a fundamental component of the broader comprehensive prevention planning for the State FFPS program. All County Information Notice (ACIN) I-73-21 and ACL 22-23 provides an overview describing the requirements of the State FFPS program, including the populations to be served, allowable services, and prevention services case requirements. # Asset Mapping and Needs Assessments for Selection of Prevention Strategies and EBPs\n\nLocal Title IV-E agencies opting into the FFPS program, and their partners must conduct asset mapping and a needs assessment to assist with the selection of prevention strategies and EBPs. The mapping should include a review of relevant demographics and other data or information that will help agencies to understand the service needs of the county or region. The CPP must include a description of the completed analysis and how the information was used to help agencies identify the candidate groups and/or other priority populations and prevention strategies that will be included in the CPP. The plan will also include the selected EBPs and the rationale for their inclusion based on this analysis. The rationale for selection must be included for each EBP. Local Title IV-E agencies must consult their local behavioral health agencies in the selection of the EBPs for the CPP. Page 43\nTitle IV-E agencies are strongly encouraged to utilize and leverage existing needs or self-assessment processes, and the information contained therein, such as the California \u2013 Child and Family Services Review County Self-Assessment as well as assessment information from partners, if desired and if such processes meet the requirements of the FFPS program. The plan must specify which primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention services will be included and how the populations disproportionately represented in the system will be prioritized for such services. # Comprehensive Prevention Plans (CPP)\n\nLocal Title IV-E agencies must submit a CPP outlining the agency\u2019s plan for primary, secondary and tertiary services and must include Title IV-E eligible service(s) pursuant to the FFPS Program outlined in WIC \u00a716585 through 16589.",

In California, the Regional Training Academies (RTAs) provide a continuum of training and professional educational opportunities for child welfare and Title IV-E Tribal staff through the State. This structure currently includes regional delivery of foundational and ad hoc trainings through five RTAs with curricula coordinated by the California Social Work Education Center (CalSWEC). Additional training resources also include the Center for Human Services at University of California at Davis Extension, the Resource Center for Family-Focused Practice (RCFFP) which focuses on family centered practice, Tribal STAR at San Diego State University Academy for Professional Excellence, which provides training and technical assistance (TA) to child welfare social workers, legal advocates, Tribal Nations and Tribal Social Service agencies in 5 Southern California counties, CalTrin and Strategies TA, which provides trainings to local service providers including Family Resource Center and community-based agency staff, and the Chief Probation Officers of California which develops and delivers foundational, supervisory and ad hoc training on child welfare practices to their members. California will leverage current training in place that have topics related to ensuring successful delivery of Family First Prevention Services. Core curriculum for child welfare staff, known as Common Core, already consists of a combination of classroom and field training on topics such as:\n\n- Trauma-informed practice\n- Integrated Core Practice Model (ICPM)\n- Tribal Engagement, ICWA including Active Efforts and culturally appropriate programs\n- Equity & cultural humility\n- Engaging children & families\n- Case planning with families and county partners\n- Conducting risk assessments, including use of assessment tools\n\nPage 46\n\n# Monitoring child safety\n\n- Key issues in child welfare, including behavioral health, substance use disorders, and intimate partner violence\n- Data systems & reporting\n\nThe RTAs are currently able to track workforce training and conduct evaluations of child welfare staff through pre-and post-surveys using an online learning and management system. Local agencies are provided access to this system, so tracking and evaluation of workforce development can be expanded to include probation, Tribes, and community pathway partners.",
