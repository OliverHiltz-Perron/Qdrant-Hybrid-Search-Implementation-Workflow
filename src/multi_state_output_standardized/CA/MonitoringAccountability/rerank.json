In addition, California will prioritize including EBPs which include direct services to parents. # CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT\n\n# OUTCOME ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\nA coordinated approach to CQI will determine protocols for regular assessment of service delivery, measuring effectiveness, and how lessons learned can improve future practice. The CDSS plans to engage external experts as well as local Title IV-E Agencies, Tribes, and program developers to develop standardized, statewide approaches to fidelity monitoring and CQI for each specific EBP which is part of the Title IV-E Prevention Plan. This statewide approach will draw upon any available technical assistance and training from each EBPs program developer. Each EBP has \u201cessential requirements\u201d and \u201cquality standards\u201d to which providers must adhere to in order to implement the EBP with fidelity to the practice model. These requirements and standards typically include training and supervision requirements, as well as specific commitments to various model requirements. Some EBPs include case review, consultation, specified assessment tools and protocols, as well as technical assistance activities as additional tools that work to ensure interventions are being delivered with fidelity to the practice model. It is anticipated that local service provider contracts will be developed or amended to include fidelity monitoring and CQI processes and requirements in accordance with state-issued guidance to ensure standardized practice for each EBP being implemented at various localities throughout the State. The CDSS will hire a contractor to assist in the development of a proposal for model fidelity oversight of EBP\u2019s across implementation sites. With guidance from the contractor, the program\u2019s governance structure, and the State Prevention Advisory Committee, the CDSS will describe the process by which model fidelity of the programs will be overseen within each individual provider contract. Additionally, data will be collected from each provider either through the model fidelity oversight process developed within the CDSS contract and to the extent that CWS-CARES can collect the information or if there are additional ways to leverage other data systems through CWS-CARES to collect the data. Essentially the data will either come directly from the providers or from CWS-CARES. The CDSS will conduct periodic\n\nPage 39\n\nreviews to assess and monitor fidelity of each EBP across local agencies and work with the purveyor to provide resources for improvements and course corrections. The model fidelity measures that will be monitored for each EBP are listed in Appendix A.",

This information will be documented in the CWS-CARES. This automated system will be used to capture the necessary data to ensure the service delivery of the program meets model fidelity standards. # CQI AND GOVERNANCE\n\nThe CDSS will also leverage contracted expertise to develop the program\u2019s CQI framework. This framework will ensure that the state\u2019s Title IV-E Program is equipped with the structures, policies, and procedures necessary to connect efforts between the state and local level to ensure that program data is analyzed to inform program changes. The CDSS has created the governance structure (figure 2. below) to oversee and guide the implementation of the Title IV-E Program. The governance structure leverages existing California government entities including the California Health and Human Services (CHHS), which oversees both CDSS and its partner agency the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), existing relationships with the California Legislature, and the Department of Finance to provide oversight, direction, and culture of the program, and to determine state resources. The structure also depicts the critical relationships with local Title IV-E agencies, tribal governments, service providers, those with lived experiences, which are engaged for planning, implementing, and evaluating the program.",

NFP is a home-visiting program that is typically implemented by trained registered nurses. NFP serves young, first-time, low-income mothers beginning early in their pregnancy until the child turns two. The primary aims of NFP are to improve the health, relationships, and economic well-being of mothers and their children. Typically, nurses provide support related to individualized goal setting, preventative health practices, parenting skills, and educational and career planning. However, the content of the program can vary based on the needs and requests of the mother. NFP aims for 60 visits that last 60-75 minutes each in the home or a location of the mother\u2019s choosing. For the first month after enrollment, visits occur weekly.",

Page 49\n\n# PREVENTION CASELOAD\n\nAs California is a state supervised county administered system, caseload monitoring is dependent on local Title IV-E agencies, which will be directly responsible for ensuring appropriate caseloads for agency and contracted caseworkers. In California there is no required standard case load minimum or maximum. The chart below from the CDSS 2020 Realignment Report describes a representative sample of caseloads in California, including Family maintenance cases during the Title IV-E waiver demonstration project. The Realignment data demonstrates that in family maintenance there is a range of 13.5-18.7 cases per caseworker across the five waiver counties. This caseload representation is most closely aligned with what is anticipated to occur in the FFPS program. Counties can compare this data to prevention caseloads as an expectation of what caseloads should be, however will also need to consider the complexity of family needs and adjust accordingly to meet those needs and the needs of staff. Using existing protocols for case assignment, caseloads will be determined at the local level, based on the complexity of family needs. Social worker supervisors of the local Title IV-E agencies are trained to monitor caseloads of individual caseworkers and can promptly address any issues impacting the effective performance of case management activities and the provision of services to families. Local Title IV-E agency contracts with other agencies or community-based organizations for delivering EBPs must specify that caseload levels will be monitored by the local Title IV-E agency to ensure that model fidelity is maintained where an EBP is being used. Where model fidelity does not dictate a prescribed caseload size, ongoing assessment of family needs and the time invested in the family\u2019s service or intervention must be taken into consideration to prevent caseloads from becoming unmanageable. Prevention caseload numbers will be tracked through CWS-CARES and available for analysis throughout the continuous monitoring of the FFPS program. Local Title IV-E agencies will describe in their CPP additional local strategies or protocols for how caseload size and type for prevention caseload size and the type of prevention case assignments will be determined, managed, and monitored. Any client to provider ratio shall not apply to any Medi-Cal delivery systems.",

Contiguous 12-month periods of services can be provided as long as the youth is assessed to have a continued need for the services. # PATHWAYS TO PREVENTION SERVICES\n\nCalifornia will provide local Title IV-E agencies the opportunity to utilize the following pathways to identify, assess and support a child or family with Title IV-E-funded prevention services. The pathways represent the ways in which vulnerable children and families may come to the attention of service providers and be approved for Title IV-E prevention services. The Family First Prevention Services Act requires collection of data to model fidelity and CQI activities involved in the prevention services. All the required FFPSA claiming data elements can be found in the Children\u2019s Bureau (August 19, 2019) Technical Bulletin #1 (REVISED): Title IV-E Prevention Program Data Elements.34 For each of the pathways below, this information will be collected in the CWS-CARES. # TITLE IV-E AGENCY PATHWAY\n\n# CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES\n\nThe Child Welfare Pathway for Title IV-E prevention services allows local child welfare agencies that are interfacing with children and families to identify, assess and support families with prevention services directly. A Child Abuse Hotline is one access point of the Child Welfare Pathway for Title IV-E funded prevention services. When the referral from the Hotline is assigned to an emergency response social worker, they contact the family to investigate the allegation(s). If the investigation results in substantiated or inconclusive findings, yet a case is not opened, a child may be identified as a\n\n34 Children\u2019s Bureau, Title IV-E Prevention Program Data Elements (June 30, 2022)\n\nPage 27\nCandidate for foster care eligible for Title IV-E Prevention Services and referred to available and appropriate prevention services under the community pathway described below. When direct involvement with the family by the local Title IV-E agency is necessary, Family Maintenance (FM) is another avenue through which families are eligible to receive voluntary or court ordered services to prevent removal of children from their homes. The FM services may occur to prevent entry into care and may be provided after reunification to prevent reentry. The FFPSA provides an opportunity for child welfare agencies to develop or expand capacity of the prevention services delivered under FM.",

For these counties there is potential crossover of the referral, assessment and service planning protocols between DR and the prevention pathways outlined in this plan. California\u2019s Community Pathway has commonalities to the DR Path 1 in that it aims to serve families outside of the CWS system, and commonalities with DR Path 2 in that the children and families served may be at a higher risk than the general public. In the community pathway these children and youth are determined to be at imminent risk of foster care. Because provision of Title IV-E prevention services is at the county\u2019s option, those counties who utilize DR will need to align their community and Title IV-E agency pathways with the paths they have created in their DR program to ensure that candidacy decisions are made by the Title IV-E agency and that reporting requirements and model fidelity are followed.",

The CDSS will ensure through the development of guidance to Title IV-E agencies that regular, ongoing safety monitoring and periodic risk assessments are included in local policies and procedures. Periodic risk assessments will also ensure that the child and family are assessed at minimum to ensure services are appropriate through a 12-month period. Per existing guidance in All County Letter (ACL) 14-36, probation officer contact requirements include ongoing monitoring of physical and emotional condition as well as adherence to the case plan including documentation of the progress towards the established goals in the family\u2019s case plan. The Case Plan will determine the needs and frequency of ongoing safety and risk monitoring. During the 12-month period the probation officer is required to visit the child and family at a minimum of once per month where these activities will occur and complete new Case Plan every 6 months while the child remains a reasonable candidate for prevention services. Re-determination for candidacy shall be updated no less than every six months or as a new change occurs and will be done by completing both the \u201cEvaluation of Imminent Risk and Reasonable Candidacy\u201d document and new Case Plan. Probation Departments who opt into providing Title IV-E prevention services will use CWS-CARES for all case documentation, including candidacy determinations, ongoing safety and risk assessments, and fiscal reporting. This will ensure that prevention cases overseen by probation departments conform with the state\u2019s prevention plan and are aligned with all model fidelity and continuous monitoring processes as required. While prevention services data reporting will be collected through CWS-CARES, additional assessment tools beyond the FFPSA prevention services candidacy determination tool will be discussed and evaluated during the CWS-CARES Project\u2019s research and development work currently underway. # COMMUNITY PATHWAY\n\nCentral to California\u2019s vision for a robust prevention continuum is expanding the services and supports universally for all children, youth, and families. Struggling families, especially those residing in impoverished neighborhoods, often voluntarily seek support from public and private community agencies, such as faith-based organizations, schools, local athletic organizations, after school programs, scouting organizations, etc.",

The PAT model includes four core components, which include personal home visits, supportive group connection events, child health and developmental screenings, and community resource networks. PAT is designed so that it can be delivered to diverse families with diverse needs, although PAT sites typically target families with specific risk factors.

An integrated system must develop a cross-collaborative network of support that meets the needs of families at every prevention level. Families\u2019 needs are diverse and cannot be addressed by any one profession or service system; those needs span public and private systems and agencies including child welfare, behavioral health, healthcare, public health, maternal and child health, education, housing and juvenile probation agencies, juvenile courts, the Child Abuse Prevention Council, First 5, childcare, and system partners. Only with programming that reaches across professions and service sectors, can California create comprehensive approaches to meeting these needs and promoting child and family well-being.",
