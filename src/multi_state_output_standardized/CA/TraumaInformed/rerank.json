The legislation requires county Child Welfare, Probation, Behavioral Health departments, county Office of Education, and Regional Centers form Interagency Leadership Teams (ILTs) to create Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) that will design, implement, or otherwise improve their System of Care for foster youth. The System of Care reforms also required the establishment of a Children and Youth System of Care State Technical Assistance (TA) Team. The teams consist of representatives from California Health and Human Services (CHHS) Agency, the CDSS, the Department of Health Care Services, Department of Developmental Services, the California Department of Education, along with assistance from the Department of Rehabilitation as needed. Additionally, the Children and Youth System of Care State Team will continue partnership with the CDSS\u2019 Office of Tribal Affairs to appropriately seek consultation with Tribes.

Appendix D includes the state\u2019s training plan which describes the content of each topic\u2019s curriculum. Topics infused throughout all trainings will include trauma-informed practice, ICPM, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), tribal engagement, and the community pathway. The CDSS is working with training partners to develop curriculum and creating a timeline for delivery of training. A rollout of FFPSA training for all staff is intended to happen as counties are ready to implement the FFPS Program, and recurring training will be considered as California\u2019s Five-Year State Prevention Plan is reviewed and amended. # Tier 1\n\nPrevention Principles will outline best practices that are necessary for prevention networks to understand and move toward a system-wide shift of investing in prevention. This system-oriented training will target the widest audience, including local service provider staff, leadership on all levels, and cross-sector partners. Tier 1 training and webinars will be ongoing and updated as needed for Continuous Quality Improvement. # Tier 2\n\nFoundational knowledge for direct services staff. This tier is focused on the needs of staff, supervisors and other professionals who will provide direct case coordination and services in both the Title IV-E and Community Pathway:\n\n- Training will ensure that staff from child welfare, probation, tribal agencies, and local service providers are qualified to complete intake assessments, develop prevention plans, engage with families and Tribes, understand when and how often to conduct risk assessments, monitor child safety, develop safety plans, and assess for continued appropriateness of prevention services. - Training will be offered to Title IV-E agency caseworkers and supervisors to ensure that foundational elements of the FFPS are incorporated into existing programs for family maintenance and probation service plans and ensure that the requirements of the ICWA are incorporated into training delivery. This tier of trainings will include the determination of candidacy and factor in the various ways in which families can be referred for services.

It is critical that there is sufficient capacity to deliver services to meet the demand for early intervention with\n\nPage 19\n\nmore families, and to serve the diverse needs of California families. Local service organizations may be contracted with to conduct assessments of the family\u2019s strengths and needs, recommend and/or plan treatment, provide case management services, and provide aftercare services. Readiness work is intended to expose gaps in the local service array which can be strategically filled by targeted service procurement by county agencies. # Re-Centering Lived Experience\n\nAs stated earlier, the CDSS considers family experiences and perceptions to be a key data source, where qualitative data are equally valued as quantitative data, and that an equity and inclusion lens will precede every phase of planning, design, and implementation. The CDSS has created intentional and targeted engagement with youth and parents to gather feedback on this Plan. Groups involved include Parents Anonymous, the California Youth Connection, the Youth Empowerment Project, and the Citizen Review Panels. These same groups that provided plan feedback will also serve as venues to discuss implementation and will serve CDSS in the creation of an advisory body which centers lived experience and influences the local and statewide implementation processes. The CDSS also considers teaming models (e.g., child and family teams, family team decision making) to be a strategy that, if deployed correctly, centers the lived experience of families in crisis and leverages families\u2019 inherent strengths and resilience to remediate the crisis. Together, teams create exponential energy and connect families to resources to meet the family\u2019s needs and support their success. In a complex service system like California, work product is created through a series of business processes which support the mission of the organization, county systems, and provider contractors. Healing from trauma and connecting youth to their natural and community supports can be challenging in government-operated systems. The key elements of the ICPM such as engagement, assessment, service planning and delivery, monitoring and adapting, and transition, not only guide existing policy and training, but also undergird this Prevention Plan.",

California will leverage current training in place that have topics related to ensuring successful delivery of Family First Prevention Services. Core curriculum for child welfare staff, known as Common Core, already consists of a combination of classroom and field training on topics such as:\n\n- Trauma-informed practice\n- Integrated Core Practice Model (ICPM)\n- Tribal Engagement, ICWA including Active Efforts and culturally appropriate programs\n- Equity & cultural humility\n- Engaging children & families\n- Case planning with families and county partners\n- Conducting risk assessments, including use of assessment tools\n\nPage 46\n\n# Monitoring child safety\n\n- Key issues in child welfare, including behavioral health, substance use disorders, and intimate partner violence\n- Data systems & reporting\n\nThe RTAs are currently able to track workforce training and conduct evaluations of child welfare staff through pre-and post-surveys using an online learning and management system. Local agencies are provided access to this system, so tracking and evaluation of workforce development can be expanded to include probation, Tribes, and community pathway partners.",

With the expiration of the Title IV-E waivers, FFPSA\u2019s authorization to use Title IV-E funds for prevention services stands to positively impact ongoing efforts to build a robust prevention continuum. Using Title IV-E funds will allow for service delivery to traditionally underserved populations and expand evidence-based practices to prevent child harm, especially the harm caused by trauma associated with detention and foster care. Below are the strategies California currently employs at each level of prevention, with those most impacted by FFPSA. # Primary Prevention\n\nPrevention at the primary level addresses general population needs and child well-being through a social determinants of health approach. Although Title IV-E funding may be unavailable to support primary prevention, California will continue to develop and fund primary prevention strategies with the following objectives:\n\n- Increasing access to supports such as childcare, food and housing;\n- Reducing poverty and improving economic stability;\n- Improving school readiness;\n- Improving transportation;\n- Increasing social connections within families and within the community;\n- Reducing substance use;\n- Improving access to healthcare;\n- Improving neighborhood safety and play areas for children and youth;\n- Increasing public awareness through engagement, education, and outreach;\n- Improving maternal health; and\n- Improving paternal engagement. For child welfare or probation agencies (hereinafter \u201clocal Title IV-E agencies\u201d) and Tribes with a Title IV-E agreement with the State who opt-in, Title IV-E prevention funding can enhance secondary and tertiary prevention services. # Secondary Prevention\n\nPrevention at the secondary level involves providing and evaluating direct services that develop and amplify protective factors and are provided to families objectively assessed to be at risk of child abuse or neglect.",

California has taken, and will continue to take, steps to improve and increase relevant trainings, such as cultural humility and implicit bias trainings, within child welfare agencies to reduce racial biases. In 2010, the CDSS received a federal grant to create the California Partners for Permanency Project (CAPP). The CAPP\u2019s goal was to improve permanency outcomes for all children and reduce disparities in permanency outcomes for African American and American Indian children in or entering Long Term Foster Care (LTFC). The CAPP implemented a Child and Family Practice Model (a precursor to the Integrated Core Practice Model now being used) that included culturally appropriate engagement; empowerment of family, tribal, and community networks; and use of culturally appropriate healing practices and practice adaptations.\u00b9\u00b3\n\nThe CAPP promoted strategies such as (1) ensuring the system becomes aware of, and more sensitively interprets, the cultural values and traditions of families being served as strengths; and (2) ensuring access to, and supporting use of, well-being and healing practices that are relevant and meaningful to the family and its culture. While these strategies were important in improving responsiveness to culture and trauma, CAPP also found that California\u2019s child welfare systems needed to be changed. Through the CAPP work, the CDSS discovered that in order to provide some of the more culturally appropriate supports that are needed for families to heal, the child welfare system must first develop or adapt internal business processes and fiscal mechanisms to effectively host and integrate those supports and services. Another important lesson learned from the CAPP Project is the level of investment needed for a sufficient, stable, trained, and well-coached workforce that can effectively deliver evidence-based or evidence-informed practices with fidelity. Without fidelity to the model, the child and family outcomes promised are unlikely to manifest.",

The Title IV-E Prevention Program established by FFPSA will complement California\u2019s existing capacity to further the safety and permanency of children and youth who are brought to the attention of community partners, Tribes, child welfare, or probation agencies. The Title IV-E Prevention Program provides a valuable opportunity to serve children, youth, parents, and caregivers, as well as expectant and parenting foster youth, to promote access to other prevention services and programs, and as such, may have a high need for immediate supports and services to prevent entry into the foster care system. California intends to use Title IV-E prevention funding, alongside other available funding streams, and coupled with other parallel reforms, to continue to build a comprehensive system of care which emphasizes prevention and early intervention services. In recent years, the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) has significantly increased the visibility and urgency around establishing a continuum of prevention services and supports throughout California. In partnership with CDSS, county child welfare agencies created the Child and Family Enrichment Cabinet in 2018, which currently supports 24 cross-sector collaborative prevention planning teams in developing and implementing local prevention plans. The Cabinet is comprised of ten county child welfare directors, all of whom are champions for expanding prevention. The Cabinet\u2019s mission is to inspire and support each California county to develop an integrated system of care that supports families in providing (or providing return to) safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments for their children. This integrated system\u2019s primary aim is keeping children safe at home by strengthening families through programs such as CalFRESH,\u00b2 California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) Homeless Assistance,\u00b3 CalWORKs Home Visiting,\u2074 and Differential Response.\u2075 California plans to leverage these existing prevention planning efforts to embed FFPSA-funded prevention services into a comprehensive local prevention continuum. 1.

Developing a community pathway is critical to an equity-centered approach to Title IV-E prevention as studies have demonstrated that \u201cracial disparities occur at various decision points in the child welfare continuum\u201d15. California\u2019s vision for prevention includes a community pathway for families to access services prior to a call being made to the child abuse hotline and for families to access services through community-based organizations when direct involvement with the local Title IV-E agency is unnecessary.

The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) defines an EBP as an \u201cintervention which has been consistently shown in several research studies to assist consumers in achieving their desired goals of health and wellness\u201d17. Well-supported EBPs have met or exceeded a standard of sufficient evidence existing to make claims of positive outcomes for specified populations of consumers. Even well-supported EBPs may need to be modified in the future as they expand and evolve to serve the diverse cultural needs of California\u2019s families. These modifications will be planned for, encouraged, and resourced as part of FFPSA implementation.

When delivered as a stand-alone EBP, Motivational Interviewing shall be delivered by clinicians, social workers, and/or case managers. As examples, clinicians may implement MI as a substance use treatment service; social workers and case managers of FRCs and CBOs may deliver MI as a family engagement and case management strategy; or Title IV-E workers may use Motivational Interviewing to improve engagement with families during each encounter. # FUTURE PLANS TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL INTERVENTIONS\n\nThe CDSS engaged a myriad of stakeholders in determining the services to include in California\u2019s five-year prevention plan. Ultimately, the ten (10) EBPs chosen are all well-supported EBPs in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse and listed in Appendix A. For each of these EBPs, California is requesting a waiver of the evaluation requirement due to the compelling effectiveness of the practices and adherence to continuous quality improvement processes included in the design. Because not all services requested by stakeholders were able to be included in the current Prevention Plan, CDSS may support additional prevention services and programs for evaluation in the future, including those which are rated as \u201csupported\u201d or \u201cpromising\u201d but lack sufficient evidence to be rated in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse as \u201cwell supported\u201d. During an annual planning process, the CDSS will consult with opt-in agencies to identify additional programs and services that align with the statewide prevention strategy, have demonstrated outcomes with specified target populations, and have the potential to meet the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse criteria. The CDSS will also consult with Tribes to. 38 The CDSS is requesting a waiver for the evaluation of Motivational Interviewing both as a substance use disorder treatment intervention as well as a cross-cutting intervention.

The most frequent request from local Title IV-E Agencies, advocates, and service providers regarding EBPs is the selection of programs that are culturally appropriate and tailored to sub-populations whose overrepresentation in the child welfare system is a symptom of the mismatch between their cultural needs and the approach to service delivery \u2013 AI/AN and African American or Black families.",
