Following consultation with counties, Tribes, and community-based organizations, as well as those with lived experience, California has determined that if a child falls within one of the categories specified below, the child can be considered for eligibility for Title IV-E prevention services. While the groups described below are at increased risk of foster care, a case-by-case, individualized assessment will be required to determine whether an individual child within that category meets the criteria of being at imminent risk of entering foster care. The following children are currently considered candidates for foster care under the existing Title IV-E foster care program and may be eligible for prevention services under Title IV-E based upon an individual assessment and determination that the child is at imminent risk of entering foster care but can remain safely in the home as long as allowable mental health, substance use, and/or in-home parent skill-based program services are provided.

In that same year, there were 37,769 court-ordered Family Maintenance (FM) cases in California, of whom 3,878 (10 percent) were removed within 12 months and placed in foster care.\u00b2\u00b2 The FFPSA provides an opportunity to expand service capacity to this population. \u2022 Probation minors subject to a petition under section 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code (WIC), and for whom the probation department determined to be at imminent risk for foster will be eligible to receive services under the Title IV-E Prevention Program.

The Juvenile Assessment Intervention System (JAIS), Positive Achievement Change Tool (PACT), Youth Level of Service/Case Management Instrument (YLS/CMI), and the Risk Resiliency Check Up Tool (RRC) all include domains that assess for safety and risk. Currently in California, probation officers conduct assessments to determine traditional candidacy for foster care using the \u201cEvaluation of Imminent Risk and Reasonable Candidacy\u201d (EIRRC) tool. The EIRRC tool is a checklist that assists in accurately identifying why and how a child is considered a candidate. If the child is clearly identified as a candidate, then a Case Plan must be developed, and the following elements must be documented:\n\n- Description of circumstances: including but not limited to behavioral issues that place the child or youth at imminent risk of removal from the home absent the indicated services. This cannot be solely a list of problems but must include why these issues will result in out-of-home placement if services are not provided. This will include behavioral issues and obstacles related to the parents or guardian. - Types of services needed: for the child or youth to remain safely in his/her home. This must include any services aimed at the parents or guardians. - Statement regarding foster care: that absents the effectiveness of services, foster care is the planned arrangement for the child or youth and identify the type of planned placement setting. For those probation departments who do not opt into providing Title IV-E prevention services, they will continue to use this assessment tool to track traditional candidacy for juvenile justice youth.",

For example, a family may have risk factors such as an historical mental health or substance use diagnosis, but the current circumstance of a hospitalization or substance use relapse may place the child or youth at imminent risk of removal and foster care placement. In these situations, when there is a recommendation that a prevention service may provide supports and interventions that mitigate such safety threats, a determination of candidacy can be made. Other examples of imminent circumstances may include but are not limited to:\n\n- Current or recent (within 6 months) family involvement with social services agency\n- Change in family relationships characterized by frequent conflict or violence;\n- Recent increase in substance use that impacts daily functioning and ability to care for the child or youth;\n- Recent incident in which a parent or guardian made a plausible threat to cause serious physical harm to a child or youth;\n- Incarceration of the caregiver;\n- Child or youth participated in criminal activity; and\n- Other recent or current circumstance that may cause family instability or a threat to the child/youth\u2019s safety or well-being.

Since the spring of 2019, the CDSS convened multiple stakeholder workgroups, including a widely attended Prevention Summit, designed to orient stakeholders, and gauge their needs and readiness to implement prevention services. The CDSS sought feedback through a detailed survey process, as well as through focused conversations with Child Welfare Directors, Chief Probation Officers, youth and parents with lived experience, service providers, and training academies. The CDSS will continue to reach out to varied partners and stakeholders as the Title IV-E Prevention Program is implemented.

Page 30\n\n# Referral, Intake and Assessment\n\nThe community pathway is an avenue in which children, youth and families can receive early intervention services at the earliest point possible to minimize the stigma of working directly with the child welfare agency. Through the community pathway, families can self-refer, or be referred by a public or private entity such as a school, healthcare provider, or local organization. Families may also be referred to the community pathway by a local Title IV-E agency that determines a family is eligible for prevention services, but a Family Maintenance case will not be opened. These referrals can identify for families the local service provider that is contracted by the Title IV-E agency for prevention services who will complete an intake assessment of the family\u2019s strengths and needs. During the intake process, the contracted agency will complete an assessment of the circumstances of the child/family. If the child/family is assessed to need mental health, substance abuse, and/or in-home parenting skill-based services for the child to remain safely at home, they will identify the child as potentially eligible for Title IV-E prevention services. # Candidacy Determination\n\nIf the local service provider identifies a child, they believe may be an eligible candidate and can provide a Title IV-E prevention service to mitigate the family\u2019s risk and safety concerns, they can submit their recommendation for candidacy to the Title IV-E agency for a review to make a candidacy determination, with appropriate consent from the family. This interaction between the local service provider and the Title IV-E agency will protect family privacy by using a unique case identifier. # Prevention Planning, Coordination of Delivery of Services\n\nUpon notification of candidacy determination, the local service provider must begin prevention planning with the family and, if applicable, in partnership with the child\u2019s Tribe(s). If more than one service is to be provided, the contracted service provider and the Title IV-E Agency will determine the roles of care coordination and how the agencies ensure that community-based prevention services are provided to support the family\u2019s unique needs. The local service provider, in partnership with the child\u2019s Tribe(s), determine how case management and coordination of services will be conducted.",

Page 29\n\nAlthough tools may be different, the case plan identifies the required assessment creating a standard across all probation departments and ensures that ongoing assessment is occurring. The CDSS will ensure through the development of guidance to Title IV-E agencies that regular, ongoing safety monitoring and periodic risk assessments are included in local policies and procedures. Periodic risk assessments will also ensure that the child and family are assessed at minimum to ensure services are appropriate through a 12-month period. Per existing guidance in All County Letter (ACL) 14-36, probation officer contact requirements include ongoing monitoring of physical and emotional condition as well as adherence to the case plan including documentation of the progress towards the established goals in the family\u2019s case plan. The Case Plan will determine the needs and frequency of ongoing safety and risk monitoring. During the 12-month period the probation officer is required to visit the child and family at a minimum of once per month where these activities will occur and complete new Case Plan every 6 months while the child remains a reasonable candidate for prevention services. Re-determination for candidacy shall be updated no less than every six months or as a new change occurs and will be done by completing both the \u201cEvaluation of Imminent Risk and Reasonable Candidacy\u201d document and new Case Plan. Probation Departments who opt into providing Title IV-E prevention services will use CWS-CARES for all case documentation, including candidacy determinations, ongoing safety and risk assessments, and fiscal reporting. This will ensure that prevention cases overseen by probation departments conform with the state\u2019s prevention plan and are aligned with all model fidelity and continuous monitoring processes as required. While prevention services data reporting will be collected through CWS-CARES, additional assessment tools beyond the FFPSA prevention services candidacy determination tool will be discussed and evaluated during the CWS-CARES Project\u2019s research and development work currently underway. # COMMUNITY PATHWAY\n\nCentral to California\u2019s vision for a robust prevention continuum is expanding the services and supports universally for all children, youth, and families.

The Title IV-E funding and prevention services also increase the ability of Family Reunification Social Workers to connect families that recently reunified to services and supports to improve the likelihood of successful transition. For children and families receiving prevention services through the Title IV-E agency pathway, standard protocols for assessment such as the use of the Structured Decision Making (SDM) tools and monthly visits by the social worker will remain. The child welfare agency is the lead coordinator of services, and it is the responsibility of the child welfare agency to ensure that all necessary data is entered into the CWS-CARES for the purposes of safety and risk monitoring and progress towards case plan goals. Updates to the family\u2019s prevention plan, including engagement efforts, ongoing safety and risk monitoring including home visits, case plan content and SDM assessments, will be documented in CWS-CARES. Per existing state regulations contained in Division 31-320 of the Child Welfare Services Manual of Policies and Procedures (MPP), requirements during social worker contacts with the child and family include ongoing monitoring of physical and emotional condition as well as adherence to the case plan including documentation of the progress towards the established goals. Child welfare social workers are required to conduct visits at least three times in the first 30 calendar days. After the initial 30 days, a visit must be conducted at least once every thirty days for ongoing safety and risk monitoring, and the majority of the visits must occur in the home. In 2007, California implemented the use of a Standardized Safety Assessment System, Structured Decision Making (SDM) across all 58 counties in California. Use of SDM assessment tools ensures that families are systematically assessed for safety, risk and needs throughout the life of any child welfare case35.

      "content": "[Document Section: INTRODUCTION]\n[Primary Topic: INTRODUCTION]\n---\nThis will provide for a shift in the current paradigm, changing from a focus on reaction to a focus on prevention and early intervention with the goals of reducing incidences of abuse and neglect, decreasing entries into foster care, reducing disproportionality, addressing systemic and historical traumas, promoting the social determinants of health, and improving the lives of children, youth, and families. The Title IV-E Prevention Program established by FFPSA will complement California\u2019s existing capacity to further the safety and permanency of children and youth who are brought to the attention of community partners, Tribes, child welfare, or probation agencies. The Title IV-E Prevention Program provides a valuable opportunity to serve children, youth, parents, and caregivers, as well as expectant and parenting foster youth, to promote access to other prevention services and programs, and as such, may have a high need for immediate supports and services to prevent entry into the foster care system. California intends to use Title IV-E prevention funding, alongside other available funding streams, and coupled with other parallel reforms, to continue to build a comprehensive system of care which emphasizes prevention and early intervention services. In recent years, the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) has significantly increased the visibility and urgency around establishing a continuum of prevention services and supports throughout California. In partnership with CDSS, county child welfare agencies created the Child and Family Enrichment Cabinet in 2018, which currently supports 24 cross-sector collaborative prevention planning teams in developing and implementing local prevention plans. The Cabinet is comprised of ten county child welfare directors, all of whom are champions for expanding prevention. The Cabinet\u2019s mission is to inspire and support each California county to develop an integrated system of care that supports families in providing (or providing return to) safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments for their children. This integrated system\u2019s primary aim is keeping children safe at home by strengthening families through programs such as CalFRESH,\u00b2 California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) Homeless Assistance,\u00b3 CalWORKs Home Visiting,\u2074 and Differential Response.\u2075 California plans to leverage these existing prevention planning efforts to embed FFPSA-funded prevention services into a comprehensive local prevention continuum. 1.

      "content": "[Document Section: Oversight of the Community Pathway, Safety Monitoring and Risk Assessments]\n[Primary Topic: Oversight of the Community Pathway, Safety Monitoring and Risk Assessments]\n---\nAs outlined above, the local Title IV-E agency is responsible for supervising and ensuring that its contractors appropriately perform all contracted Title IV-E administrative activities in accordance with federal and state requirements, and will receive and review periodic, aggregate reports via CWS-CARES to support their oversight of their contracted service providers. Information within the reports may include, safety and risk monitoring, adherence to model fidelity standards, length, and completion of services etc. The local Title IV-E agency, as a part of continuous monitoring will address any concerns with the local service provider over observed systemic issues in care coordination. If the local Title IV-E agency identifies a problem through their review of periodic reports or other performance monitoring activities, they will follow up with their contracted entities to address it immediately. Appendix C Includes the following graphic with additional detail to describe an overview of the activities within each step of the Community Pathway. Figure 1 below illustrates the anticipated steps to meet the requirements of FFPSA within the Community Pathway. For further information, Appendix C contains additional descriptions of the activities within each step of the Community Pathway.

For these counties there is potential crossover of the referral, assessment and service planning protocols between DR and the prevention pathways outlined in this plan. California\u2019s Community Pathway has commonalities to the DR Path 1 in that it aims to serve families outside of the CWS system, and commonalities with DR Path 2 in that the children and families served may be at a higher risk than the general public. In the community pathway these children and youth are determined to be at imminent risk of foster care. Because provision of Title IV-E prevention services is at the county\u2019s option, those counties who utilize DR will need to align their community and Title IV-E agency pathways with the paths they have created in their DR program to ensure that candidacy decisions are made by the Title IV-E agency and that reporting requirements and model fidelity are followed.",
