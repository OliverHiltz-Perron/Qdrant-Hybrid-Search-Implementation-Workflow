Following consultation with counties, Tribes, and community-based organizations, as well as those with lived experience, California has determined that if a child falls within one of the categories specified below, the child can be considered for eligibility for Title IV-E prevention services. While the groups described below are at increased risk of foster care, a case-by-case, individualized assessment will be required to determine whether an individual child within that category meets the criteria of being at imminent risk of entering foster care. The following children are currently considered candidates for foster care under the existing Title IV-E foster care program and may be eligible for prevention services under Title IV-E based upon an individual assessment and determination that the child is at imminent risk of entering foster care but can remain safely in the home as long as allowable mental health, substance use, and/or in-home parent skill-based program services are provided.

In that same year, there were 37,769 court-ordered Family Maintenance (FM) cases in California, of whom 3,878 (10 percent) were removed within 12 months and placed in foster care.\u00b2\u00b2 The FFPSA provides an opportunity to expand service capacity to this population. \u2022 Probation minors subject to a petition under section 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code (WIC), and for whom the probation department determined to be at imminent risk for foster will be eligible to receive services under the Title IV-E Prevention Program.

The Juvenile Assessment Intervention System (JAIS), Positive Achievement Change Tool (PACT), Youth Level of Service/Case Management Instrument (YLS/CMI), and the Risk Resiliency Check Up Tool (RRC) all include domains that assess for safety and risk. Currently in California, probation officers conduct assessments to determine traditional candidacy for foster care using the \u201cEvaluation of Imminent Risk and Reasonable Candidacy\u201d (EIRRC) tool. The EIRRC tool is a checklist that assists in accurately identifying why and how a child is considered a candidate. If the child is clearly identified as a candidate, then a Case Plan must be developed, and the following elements must be documented:\n\n- Description of circumstances: including but not limited to behavioral issues that place the child or youth at imminent risk of removal from the home absent the indicated services. This cannot be solely a list of problems but must include why these issues will result in out-of-home placement if services are not provided. This will include behavioral issues and obstacles related to the parents or guardian. - Types of services needed: for the child or youth to remain safely in his/her home. This must include any services aimed at the parents or guardians. - Statement regarding foster care: that absents the effectiveness of services, foster care is the planned arrangement for the child or youth and identify the type of planned placement setting. For those probation departments who do not opt into providing Title IV-E prevention services, they will continue to use this assessment tool to track traditional candidacy for juvenile justice youth.",

For example, a family may have risk factors such as an historical mental health or substance use diagnosis, but the current circumstance of a hospitalization or substance use relapse may place the child or youth at imminent risk of removal and foster care placement. In these situations, when there is a recommendation that a prevention service may provide supports and interventions that mitigate such safety threats, a determination of candidacy can be made. Other examples of imminent circumstances may include but are not limited to:\n\n- Current or recent (within 6 months) family involvement with social services agency\n- Change in family relationships characterized by frequent conflict or violence;\n- Recent increase in substance use that impacts daily functioning and ability to care for the child or youth;\n- Recent incident in which a parent or guardian made a plausible threat to cause serious physical harm to a child or youth;\n- Incarceration of the caregiver;\n- Child or youth participated in criminal activity; and\n- Other recent or current circumstance that may cause family instability or a threat to the child/youth\u2019s safety or well-being.

Since the spring of 2019, the CDSS convened multiple stakeholder workgroups, including a widely attended Prevention Summit, designed to orient stakeholders, and gauge their needs and readiness to implement prevention services. The CDSS sought feedback through a detailed survey process, as well as through focused conversations with Child Welfare Directors, Chief Probation Officers, youth and parents with lived experience, service providers, and training academies. The CDSS will continue to reach out to varied partners and stakeholders as the Title IV-E Prevention Program is implemented. In addition, the CDSS has committed to an annual planning update process in collaboration with counties and stakeholders, and in consultation with Tribes. At that time, program enhancements such as adding EBPs or modifying candidacy populations may be considered.

When the referral from the Hotline is assigned to an emergency response social worker, they contact the family to investigate the allegation(s). If the investigation results in substantiated or inconclusive findings, yet a case is not opened, a child may be identified as a\n\n34 Children\u2019s Bureau, Title IV-E Prevention Program Data Elements (June 30, 2022)\n\nPage 27\nCandidate for foster care eligible for Title IV-E Prevention Services and referred to available and appropriate prevention services under the community pathway described below. When direct involvement with the family by the local Title IV-E agency is necessary, Family Maintenance (FM) is another avenue through which families are eligible to receive voluntary or court ordered services to prevent removal of children from their homes. The FM services may occur to prevent entry into care and may be provided after reunification to prevent reentry. The FFPSA provides an opportunity for child welfare agencies to develop or expand capacity of the prevention services delivered under FM.",

Page 30\n\n# Referral, Intake and Assessment\n\nThe community pathway is an avenue in which children, youth and families can receive early intervention services at the earliest point possible to minimize the stigma of working directly with the child welfare agency. Through the community pathway, families can self-refer, or be referred by a public or private entity such as a school, healthcare provider, or local organization. Families may also be referred to the community pathway by a local Title IV-E agency that determines a family is eligible for prevention services, but a Family Maintenance case will not be opened. These referrals can identify for families the local service provider that is contracted by the Title IV-E agency for prevention services who will complete an intake assessment of the family\u2019s strengths and needs. During the intake process, the contracted agency will complete an assessment of the circumstances of the child/family. If the child/family is assessed to need mental health, substance abuse, and/or in-home parenting skill-based services for the child to remain safely at home, they will identify the child as potentially eligible for Title IV-E prevention services. # Candidacy Determination\n\nIf the local service provider identifies a child, they believe may be an eligible candidate and can provide a Title IV-E prevention service to mitigate the family\u2019s risk and safety concerns, they can submit their recommendation for candidacy to the Title IV-E agency for a review to make a candidacy determination, with appropriate consent from the family. This interaction between the local service provider and the Title IV-E agency will protect family privacy by using a unique case identifier. # Prevention Planning, Coordination of Delivery of Services\n\nUpon notification of candidacy determination, the local service provider must begin prevention planning with the family and, if applicable, in partnership with the child\u2019s Tribe(s). If more than one service is to be provided, the contracted service provider and the Title IV-E Agency will determine the roles of care coordination and how the agencies ensure that community-based prevention services are provided to support the family\u2019s unique needs. The local service provider, in partnership with the child\u2019s Tribe(s), determine how case management and coordination of services will be conducted.",

Page 29\n\nAlthough tools may be different, the case plan identifies the required assessment creating a standard across all probation departments and ensures that ongoing assessment is occurring. The CDSS will ensure through the development of guidance to Title IV-E agencies that regular, ongoing safety monitoring and periodic risk assessments are included in local policies and procedures. Periodic risk assessments will also ensure that the child and family are assessed at minimum to ensure services are appropriate through a 12-month period. Per existing guidance in All County Letter (ACL) 14-36, probation officer contact requirements include ongoing monitoring of physical and emotional condition as well as adherence to the case plan including documentation of the progress towards the established goals in the family\u2019s case plan. The Case Plan will determine the needs and frequency of ongoing safety and risk monitoring. During the 12-month period the probation officer is required to visit the child and family at a minimum of once per month where these activities will occur and complete new Case Plan every 6 months while the child remains a reasonable candidate for prevention services. Re-determination for candidacy shall be updated no less than every six months or as a new change occurs and will be done by completing both the \u201cEvaluation of Imminent Risk and Reasonable Candidacy\u201d document and new Case Plan. Probation Departments who opt into providing Title IV-E prevention services will use CWS-CARES for all case documentation, including candidacy determinations, ongoing safety and risk assessments, and fiscal reporting. This will ensure that prevention cases overseen by probation departments conform with the state\u2019s prevention plan and are aligned with all model fidelity and continuous monitoring processes as required. While prevention services data reporting will be collected through CWS-CARES, additional assessment tools beyond the FFPSA prevention services candidacy determination tool will be discussed and evaluated during the CWS-CARES Project\u2019s research and development work currently underway. # COMMUNITY PATHWAY\n\nCentral to California\u2019s vision for a robust prevention continuum is expanding the services and supports universally for all children, youth, and families.

The Title IV-E funding and prevention services also increase the ability of Family Reunification Social Workers to connect families that recently reunified to services and supports to improve the likelihood of successful transition. For children and families receiving prevention services through the Title IV-E agency pathway, standard protocols for assessment such as the use of the Structured Decision Making (SDM) tools and monthly visits by the social worker will remain.

Updates to the family\u2019s prevention plan, including engagement efforts, ongoing safety and risk monitoring including home visits, case plan content and SDM assessments, will be documented in CWS-CARES. Per existing state regulations contained in Division 31-320 of the Child Welfare Services Manual of Policies and Procedures (MPP), requirements during social worker contacts with the child and family include ongoing monitoring of physical and emotional condition as well as adherence to the case plan including documentation of the progress towards the established goals. Child welfare social workers are required to conduct visits at least three times in the first 30 calendar days. After the initial 30 days, a visit must be conducted at least once every thirty days for ongoing safety and risk monitoring, and the majority of the visits must occur in the home. In 2007, California implemented the use of a Standardized Safety Assessment System, Structured Decision Making (SDM) across all 58 counties in California.

      "content": "[Document Section: INTRODUCTION]\n[Primary Topic: INTRODUCTION]\n---\nThis will provide for a shift in the current paradigm, changing from a focus on reaction to a focus on prevention and early intervention with the goals of reducing incidences of abuse and neglect, decreasing entries into foster care, reducing disproportionality, addressing systemic and historical traumas, promoting the social determinants of health, and improving the lives of children, youth, and families. The Title IV-E Prevention Program established by FFPSA will complement California\u2019s existing capacity to further the safety and permanency of children and youth who are brought to the attention of community partners, Tribes, child welfare, or probation agencies. The Title IV-E Prevention Program provides a valuable opportunity to serve children, youth, parents, and caregivers, as well as expectant and parenting foster youth, to promote access to other prevention services and programs, and as such, may have a high need for immediate supports and services to prevent entry into the foster care system. California intends to use Title IV-E prevention funding, alongside other available funding streams, and coupled with other parallel reforms, to continue to build a comprehensive system of care which emphasizes prevention and early intervention services. In recent years, the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) has significantly increased the visibility and urgency around establishing a continuum of prevention services and supports throughout California. In partnership with CDSS, county child welfare agencies created the Child and Family Enrichment Cabinet in 2018, which currently supports 24 cross-sector collaborative prevention planning teams in developing and implementing local prevention plans. The Cabinet is comprised of ten county child welfare directors, all of whom are champions for expanding prevention. The Cabinet\u2019s mission is to inspire and support each California county to develop an integrated system of care that supports families in providing (or providing return to) safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments for their children. This integrated system\u2019s primary aim is keeping children safe at home by strengthening families through programs such as CalFRESH,\u00b2 California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) Homeless Assistance,\u00b3 CalWORKs Home Visiting,\u2074 and Differential Response.\u2075 California plans to leverage these existing prevention planning efforts to embed FFPSA-funded prevention services into a comprehensive local prevention continuum. 1.

Information within the reports may include, safety and risk monitoring, adherence to model fidelity standards, length, and completion of services etc. The local Title IV-E agency, as a part of continuous monitoring will address any concerns with the local service provider over observed systemic issues in care coordination. If the local Title IV-E agency identifies a problem through their review of periodic reports or other performance monitoring activities, they will follow up with their contracted entities to address it immediately. Appendix C Includes the following graphic with additional detail to describe an overview of the activities within each step of the Community Pathway.

For these counties there is potential crossover of the referral, assessment and service planning protocols between DR and the prevention pathways outlined in this plan. California\u2019s Community Pathway has commonalities to the DR Path 1 in that it aims to serve families outside of the CWS system, and commonalities with DR Path 2 in that the children and families served may be at a higher risk than the general public. In the community pathway these children and youth are determined to be at imminent risk of foster care. Because provision of Title IV-E prevention services is at the county\u2019s option, those counties who utilize DR will need to align their community and Title IV-E agency pathways with the paths they have created in their DR program to ensure that candidacy decisions are made by the Title IV-E agency and that reporting requirements and model fidelity are followed.",

Biases or cultural misunderstandings and distrust between child welfare decision makers and families also contribute to children\u2019s and youth\u2019s removal from their homes into foster care.11\n\nWith this understanding in mind, the State and local governments are relying more on the help of community partners to implement culturally responsive community programs and services that can better serve Black families and communities. Economic marginalization and disproportionate levels of poverty also increase Black families\u2019 exposure to the child welfare system. Black households experience homelessness at a disproportionate rate relative to the general population.

The CDSS envisions \u201cAn integrated state-wide system that supports families to provide safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments for their children and youth\u201d.6\n\nThis vision involves a system of care supported by a framework for prevention that includes primary, secondary, and tertiary strategies, grounded in principles of fairness and equity. # THEORY OF CHANGE:\n\nIF California shapes policy and practice to promote the safety and well-being of its children, youth, and families, THEN California\u2019s prevention partners and family strengthening agencies can:\n\n- Promote child and family safety and well-being by strengthening the capacity within communities to care for one another:\n- Work effectively together as a network of support; and\n- Leverage resources to enhance impact. SO THAT an integrated state-wide system supports families to provide safe, stable, and nurturing relationships and environments for their children and youth, THEREBY preventing child abuse and neglect. By applying the \u201cno wrong door\u201d philosophy of entry to supports and services for children, youth, and families, help can be equitably and respectfully provided at every level of need within the community in which a family lives, grows, works, and plays. The CDSS will promote and support strategies for local prevention planning that include:\n\n- Building and strengthening primary prevention and early interventions predating\n\n6 OCAP 2020-2025 Strategic Plan\n\nPage 7\nrisk indicators for harm and health problems.",

Any of the Title IV-E funded prevention services included in Appendix A can be chosen by local IV-E agencies to fill a service gap in the continuum of services available in each jurisdiction or to reach a population where services are not yet available to meet the local demographic\u2019s unique and culturally diverse needs. These services can also be leveraged when other funds, such as those described below, have been applied but do not cover all activities within an EBP or when a recipient does not qualify for services through other funding sources. The Title IV-E prevention services funding is the \u201cpayer of last resort\u201d as required by FFPSA. The CDSS and DHCS will provide support through the dissemination of joint guidance on EBPs that include activities eligible under Medi-Cal once any necessary federal Medicaid approvals are obtained. Other payers for services may include individual insurance plans and CalWORKs or similar safety-net funding sources. The State will receive a 50 percent federal match for the delivery of these EBPs and will require that they be delivered with model fidelity by service providers as defined by the purveyor of the EBP. Upon federal approval, the evaluation process outlined in the federal law can be waived for EBPs in this Plan, all of which are Well-Supported EBPs according to the Title IV-E. Page 37\n\nPrevention Services Clearinghouse. California is thereby requesting a waiver of the evaluation of each EBP the state has chosen, as included in Appendix A. The cultural relevance of EBPs has been raised as a concern by stakeholders. To meet model fidelity standards, support is available for providers of EBPs from program developers who can assist with creative solutions to accommodate the needs of diverse populations. Accommodations can be made to the well-supported EBPs for cultural appropriateness with guidance from EBP providers to ensure model fidelity standards are maintained. California intends to use Motivational Interviewing (MI) as a cross-cutting case management intervention beyond its application to substance use disorder treatment and has requested the waiver for evaluation aspect. Motivational Interviewing has shown considerable success as an application to service interventions including in-home parenting skill-building, mental health treatment, and family engagement and interaction. Motivational Interviewing may be applied in a variety of settings such as community agency and clinical settings as a stand-alone EBP intervention or in parallel with other EBPs providing those EBPs are being delivered with model fidelity.",

NFP is a home-visiting program that is typically implemented by trained registered nurses. NFP serves young, first-time, low-income mothers beginning early in their pregnancy until the child turns two. The primary aims of NFP are to improve the health, relationships, and economic well-being of mothers and their children. Typically, nurses provide support related to individualized goal setting, preventative health practices, parenting skills, and educational and career planning. However, the content of the program can vary based on the needs and requests of the mother. NFP aims for 60 visits that last 60-75 minutes each in the home or a location of the mother\u2019s choosing. For the first month after enrollment, visits occur weekly.",

Page 10\n\nThe data provided by the California Child Welfare Indicators Project (CCWIP) at the University of California, Berkeley demonstrate American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) and Black families are over-represented and experience disparity in most aspects of California\u2019s child welfare system. This data (depicted in Appendix B) show that Black and AI/AN children and youth are disproportionately more likely to be involved in the child welfare system, to be the subject of child maltreatment allegations, and to be placed in foster care. Black and AI/AN children and youth disproportionately yield high abuse and neglect substantiation rates, as well as higher rates of entry and re-entry to foster care, while AI/AN and Asian/Pacific Islander children have a higher rate of short stays in foster care. Furthermore, poverty (economic inequity) and structural racism are contributing factors to these disproportionalities and disparities. While the following section focuses on systemic data regarding Black and AI/AN, many of the same inequities contribute to adverse outcomes for Latino families and families with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQ+) children or youth. California fully intends to develop a Title IV-E Prevention Program whose service array contains evidence-based practices (EBPs) which have proven success with historically underserved racial and ethnic groups or can be adaptable to meet cultural needs when identified. In 2020, the CCWIP reported there were 60,045 children and youth aged 0-20 in California\u2019s Child Welfare system served by local Title IV-E Agencies. According to the 2019 CCWIP data, African American or Black children and youth make up 21.5 percent of the foster system but are only 5.6 percent of the general California population and are 2.8 times more likely to be reported as victims in child maltreatment allegations than white children. Also, per CCWIP in 2019, Hispanic or Latino children and youth entered foster care at a rate of 3.6 per 1,000 children, and American Indian children and youth at a rate of 8.6 per 1,000 children.",

An integrated system must develop a cross-collaborative network of support that meets the needs of families at every prevention level. Families\u2019 needs are diverse and cannot be addressed by any one profession or service system; those needs span public and private systems and agencies including child welfare, behavioral health, healthcare, public health, maternal and child health, education, housing and juvenile probation agencies, juvenile courts, the Child Abuse Prevention Council, First 5, childcare, and system partners. Only with programming that reaches across professions and service sectors, can California create comprehensive approaches to meeting these needs and promoting child and family well-being.",

With the expiration of the Title IV-E waivers, FFPSA\u2019s authorization to use Title IV-E funds for prevention services stands to positively impact ongoing efforts to build a robust prevention continuum. Using Title IV-E funds will allow for service delivery to traditionally underserved populations and expand evidence-based practices to prevent child harm, especially the harm caused by trauma associated with detention and foster care. Below are the strategies California currently employs at each level of prevention, with those most impacted by FFPSA. # Primary Prevention\n\nPrevention at the primary level addresses general population needs and child well-being through a social determinants of health approach. Although Title IV-E funding may be unavailable to support primary prevention, California will continue to develop and fund primary prevention strategies with the following objectives:\n\n- Increasing access to supports such as childcare, food and housing;\n- Reducing poverty and improving economic stability;\n- Improving school readiness;\n- Improving transportation;\n- Increasing social connections within families and within the community;\n- Reducing substance use;\n- Improving access to healthcare;\n- Improving neighborhood safety and play areas for children and youth;\n- Increasing public awareness through engagement, education, and outreach;\n- Improving maternal health; and\n- Improving paternal engagement. For child welfare or probation agencies (hereinafter \u201clocal Title IV-E agencies\u201d) and Tribes with a Title IV-E agreement with the State who opt-in, Title IV-E prevention funding can enhance secondary and tertiary prevention services. # Secondary Prevention\n\nPrevention at the secondary level involves providing and evaluating direct services that develop and amplify protective factors and are provided to families objectively assessed to be at risk of child abuse or neglect.",

It is critical that there is sufficient capacity to deliver services to meet the demand for early intervention with\n\nPage 19\n\nmore families, and to serve the diverse needs of California families. Local service organizations may be contracted with to conduct assessments of the family\u2019s strengths and needs, recommend and/or plan treatment, provide case management services, and provide aftercare services. Readiness work is intended to expose gaps in the local service array which can be strategically filled by targeted service procurement by county agencies. # Re-Centering Lived Experience\n\nAs stated earlier, the CDSS considers family experiences and perceptions to be a key data source, where qualitative data are equally valued as quantitative data, and that an equity and inclusion lens will precede every phase of planning, design, and implementation. The CDSS has created intentional and targeted engagement with youth and parents to gather feedback on this Plan. Groups involved include Parents Anonymous, the California Youth Connection, the Youth Empowerment Project, and the Citizen Review Panels. These same groups that provided plan feedback will also serve as venues to discuss implementation and will serve CDSS in the creation of an advisory body which centers lived experience and influences the local and statewide implementation processes. The CDSS also considers teaming models (e.g., child and family teams, family team decision making) to be a strategy that, if deployed correctly, centers the lived experience of families in crisis and leverages families\u2019 inherent strengths and resilience to remediate the crisis. Together, teams create exponential energy and connect families to resources to meet the family\u2019s needs and support their success. In a complex service system like California, work product is created through a series of business processes which support the mission of the organization, county systems, and provider contractors. Healing from trauma and connecting youth to their natural and community supports can be challenging in government-operated systems. The key elements of the ICPM such as engagement, assessment, service planning and delivery, monitoring and adapting, and transition, not only guide existing policy and training, but also undergird this Prevention Plan.",

The local Title IV-E agency\u2019s role is peripheral, and its purpose is to be the authorizing entity for Title IV-E funded prevention services that determines eligibility and maintains responsibility for supervising the Title IV-E funded activities performed by the contracted community agency. Developing a community pathway is critical to an equity-centered approach to Title IV-E prevention as studies have demonstrated that \u201cracial disparities occur at various decision points in the child welfare continuum\u201d15. California\u2019s vision for prevention includes a community pathway for families to access services prior to a call being made to the child abuse hotline and for families to access services through community-based organizations when direct involvement with the local Title IV-E agency is unnecessary.

Evidence can be obtained through a variety of methods such as randomized clinical trials, experimental studies, or meta-analyses16. The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) defines an EBP as an \u201cintervention which has been consistently shown in several research studies to assist consumers in achieving their desired goals of health and wellness\u201d17. Well-supported EBPs have met or exceeded a standard of sufficient evidence existing to make claims of positive outcomes for specified populations of consumers. Even well-supported EBPs may need to be modified in the future as they expand and evolve to serve the diverse cultural needs of California\u2019s families. These modifications will be planned for, encouraged, and resourced as part of FFPSA implementation.

The CDSS is working collaboratively with DHCS to strengthen health preventative programs and systems of care by improving pathways for access to services, which is a fundamental goal of the FFPSA. # Coordination with Title IV-B Services\n\nCalifornia will ensure that the Title IV-E Prevention Program and Title IV-B California Family Services Plan (CFSP) goals align. The California Title IV-E Prevention Program will function alongside other prevention programs and funds, such as Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) funding, FRCs, and contracts with, or grants to, CBOs, all acting in concert in order to move the gravitational center of child and family serving systems upstream. Within this framework, local Title IV-E Agencies can provide a complete and comprehensive array of services to meet the needs of children and families across the entire continuum of care. Prevention services provided for children and parents, or caregivers will be coordinated with services provided under Subparts 1 and 2 of Title IV-B of the Social Security Act. Title IV-B, Subpart 1 funds are primarily used for child welfare caseworker services. In this capacity, these funds support essential caseworker activities with children and families. Title IV-B, Subpart 2 funds support case worker visits, kinship navigator programs, and family services and supports under the PSSF program. The CDSS will inform and educate the local Title IV-E Agencies on how the services within these programs may overlap. Local Title IV-E agencies are required to complete an assessment to determine how to best spend their PSSF funds. During this process the CDSS will encourage the local Title IV-E agencies to select a mix of programs in their CPP including those which are not funded by Title IV-E. The CDSS is committed to programs and processes that complement each other and serve the overall purpose of creating a robust service array that creates and supports a full system of care for children, youth, and families.",

Prevention activities must focus on trauma mitigation, reduction of negative consequences, and prevention of recurrence. If child maltreatment is not prevented, recurrence could result in detention of children and youth, and their placement in foster care. Tertiary strategic objectives include:\n\n- Providing family preservation or reunification services;\n- Providing permanency planning;\n- Offering parent support groups that help parents strengthen positive parenting behaviors and attitudes\\*;\n- Providing behavioral health and wellness services for children, youth, and families affected by maltreatment\\*; and\n- Providing parent mentoring programs to families in crisis\\*. - Strategic objectives are aligned with FFPSA-eligible services\\*\n\n# EQUITY AND INCLUSION AS A PRIMARY LENS\n\nBlack/brown, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) face particular disparities and disproportionalities in service access and outcomes that stem from historical inequities and systemic factors. This plan has been created to reflect California\u2019s ongoing commitment to increasing equitable approaches to child and family well-being and addressing the disparities that impact BIPOC families. An \u2018equity and inclusion\u2019 lens will precede every phase of planning, design, and implementation of FFPSA as a part of broad prevention efforts. An equity lens prescribes that family experiences and perceptions are a key data source for driving program design, and that qualitative data are equally valued as quantitative data. The CDSS has created intentional and targeted engagement with youth and parents to gather feedback on the Five-Year State Prevention Plan and will continue to engage these individuals and communities in a culturally appropriate way throughout implementation.",

The ICWA compliance is the focus of this effort. Once fully developed, the ICWA State Plan will also account for delivery of prevention services, and work to ensure the delivery of culturally relevant services, in collaboration with a child\u2019s Tribe, as a part of active efforts to maintain an Indian child with their family. - An ongoing workgroup with Tribes regarding the Federal Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) data requirements related to AI/AN children and youth. The workgroup, comprised of state, tribal, and county representation, is planning for the build of the new statewide comprehensive child welfare information system to ensure that ICWA data elements are captured and measured through the AFCARS. Improved data collection will, at minimum, help California understand how to better meet the needs of the tribal families with longer term goals to eliminate disproportionality. CDSS Child and Family Service Plan\n\nThe APSR is an annual progress report to the Child and Family Services Plan submitted to the Federal Administration of Children and Families as a requirement to receive funding under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act. The APSR is a report to the Plan, which includes building ICWA. Page 13\n\nCalifornia\u2019s prevention efforts will be coordinated in consultation and collaboration with Tribes to ensure the provision of culturally appropriate prevention services in a manner consistent with active efforts to support Indian families in both rural and urban settings. Historically, rural local Title IV-E agencies have fewer local funding resources to draw upon, and struggle to meet the needs of their Tribal families. While Tribes have established culturally appropriate services to meet their members\u2019 needs, limited funding has typically been available through child welfare agencies. The availability of Title IV-E prevention services will help to address these resource deficits. # Address the Systemic Disparities Black Families Face in Child Welfare Programs\n\nThe significant histories of systemic racism in society and in government actions have also had lasting impacts within California\u2019s child welfare programs on Black children and families.",

Appendix D includes the state\u2019s training plan which describes the content of each topic\u2019s curriculum. Topics infused throughout all trainings will include trauma-informed practice, ICPM, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), tribal engagement, and the community pathway. The CDSS is working with training partners to develop curriculum and creating a timeline for delivery of training. A rollout of FFPSA training for all staff is intended to happen as counties are ready to implement the FFPS Program, and recurring training will be considered as California\u2019s Five-Year State Prevention Plan is reviewed and amended. # Tier 1\n\nPrevention Principles will outline best practices that are necessary for prevention networks to understand and move toward a system-wide shift of investing in prevention. This system-oriented training will target the widest audience, including local service provider staff, leadership on all levels, and cross-sector partners. Tier 1 training and webinars will be ongoing and updated as needed for Continuous Quality Improvement. # Tier 2\n\nFoundational knowledge for direct services staff. This tier is focused on the needs of staff, supervisors and other professionals who will provide direct case coordination and services in both the Title IV-E and Community Pathway:\n\n- Training will ensure that staff from child welfare, probation, tribal agencies, and local service providers are qualified to complete intake assessments, develop prevention plans, engage with families and Tribes, understand when and how often to conduct risk assessments, monitor child safety, develop safety plans, and assess for continued appropriateness of prevention services. - Training will be offered to Title IV-E agency caseworkers and supervisors to ensure that foundational elements of the FFPS are incorporated into existing programs for family maintenance and probation service plans and ensure that the requirements of the ICWA are incorporated into training delivery. This tier of trainings will include the determination of candidacy and factor in the various ways in which families can be referred for services.

The PAT model includes four core components, which include personal home visits, supportive group connection events, child health and developmental screenings, and community resource networks. PAT is designed so that it can be delivered to diverse families with diverse needs, although PAT sites typically target families with specific risk factors.

Several rural and smaller jurisdictions still struggle to garner the resources to deploy EBPs at scale. Many EBPs are currently being delivered through braided funding from a variety of sources, such as Medi-Cal, the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA), CalWORKs, and local sources such as First 5. This section describes California\u2019s strategies for the initial selection of EBPs to launch the implementation of the Title IV-E Prevention Program established by the FFPSA. The CDSS reviewed several criteria to select EBPs for California\u2019s population the target population to include in the prevention state service array, including:\n\n- the extent to which the EBP was currently being implemented in California,\n- the qualifications of those who would be delivering the EBP,\n- the eligibility requirements of the EBP,\n- whether the EBP was effective at serving BIPOC children and families,\n- the amount of support provided by the purveyor of the EBP and\n- whether or not the EBP required an evaluation. The EBPs relevant to Title IV-E prevention services implementation that was developed in the AirTable created by Children Now.37 Reviewing this AirTable provided the CDSS with information about each EBP which assisted in selecting the ten EBPs listed in Appendix A. At the local level, counties will have the flexibility to select the EBPs from that list that best meet the needs of their children, youth, and families.",

Depending on the current level of local ability to provide prevention programming, agencies are encouraged to begin the planning process with capacity assessments conducted locally. This information, as well as information gathered during the asset mapping and strengths and needs assessment process, will enable them to assess whether their current service array meets local identified needs, and how Title IV-E funded prevention services might fill any identified gaps. Asset mapping is a process whereby a community\u2019s assets are specifically identified, described, and often visualized geographically on a map. This process provides information about the strengths and resources of a community, can help uncover solutions, and assists with thinking. 37 Children Now AirTable, Prevention Services Inventory\n\nPage 36\nof how to build on current assets to address community needs and improve wellbeing. Similarly, a strength and needs assessment is a process by which information and data is gathered regarding the needs of a community. These assessment steps are conducted to determine specified needs and strengths which lead to the development of action steps. In this way, counties will be able to align Title IV-E funded EBP selection and implementation timelines based on the demonstrated needs of their jurisdiction as evidenced by the data collected from the asset map and strength and needs assessment. As local Title IV-E agencies begin their planning process, county child welfare agencies must engage local Tribes on the decision to opt in and the services for inclusion in the local Comprehensive Prevention Plan (CPP). Communication with representatives of local tribes must include the outcome and reasons for decisions made regarding the services in the local CPP. Local Title IV-E agencies must also partner with local Tribes when developing a CPP to outline how services to Indian families will be provided, and to ensure that the plan meets the unique needs of Indian children and families and ensures access to culturally appropriate services. During the assessment phase, local Title IV-E agencies are encouraged to map existing local funding sources to better understand how these funds can be leveraged and combined with other eligible funding sources. This could include funding for traditional services, especially those used by Tribes, that meet cultural needs but may not yet be eligible for Title IV-E funding, and funding for the evaluations that may be required to meet the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse criteria to permit use of Title IV-E funding for supported and/or promising EBPs.",

To improve consultation efforts with Tribes, the CDSS instituted the Tribal Consultation Policy (TCP) in 2017 to guide consultations between the CDSS and the 109 federally recognized Tribes in California on policies and procedures that affect Tribes. The Five-Year State Prevention Plan\u2019s review adhered to the 2017 TCP. These recent changes within the CDSS have supported the State\u2019s efforts to build on prior work engaging communities and increasing partnerships with BIPOC, Tribes, and immigrant communities, as well as supporting the additional work that is necessary to strengthen equity within CDSS programs. These structures will also support the equity efforts for implementation of Title IV-E prevention services under FFPSA.

The United States and California\u2019s history of actions, laws and policies discriminating against American Indian/Alaska native\u2019s and denying the existence of tribal sovereignty has long lasting impacts causing trauma today. The detrimental impact of these actions on tribal children and families is evident in the overrepresentation of American Indian and Alaska native children in the child welfare system and in foster care. California recognizes the significant work that must be done to address the impacts of systemic and historical trauma and is committed to working with Tribes to address these impacts and create healing opportunities. The CDSS is especially committed to improving the outcomes of AI/AN children, youth, and families. The CDSS has Title IV-E Agreements with the Yurok and Karuk Tribes that support partnering in government-to-government relationships aiming to support Tribes\u2019 control over programs and services that assist AI/AN children and families. Over the last several years, the CDSS has ramped up efforts to improve relationships with Tribes by ensuring that the needs of AI/AN families are consistently at the forefront of policy development.

In California there is no required standard case load minimum or maximum. The chart below from the CDSS 2020 Realignment Report describes a representative sample of caseloads in California, including Family maintenance cases during the Title IV-E waiver demonstration project. The Realignment data demonstrates that in family maintenance there is a range of 13.5-18.7 cases per caseworker across the five waiver counties. This caseload representation is most closely aligned with what is anticipated to occur in the FFPS program. Counties can compare this data to prevention caseloads as an expectation of what caseloads should be, however will also need to consider the complexity of family needs and adjust accordingly to meet those needs and the needs of staff. Using existing protocols for case assignment, caseloads will be determined at the local level, based on the complexity of family needs. Social worker supervisors of the local Title IV-E agencies are trained to monitor caseloads of individual caseworkers and can promptly address any issues impacting the effective performance of case management activities and the provision of services to families. Local Title IV-E agency contracts with other agencies or community-based organizations for delivering EBPs must specify that caseload levels will be monitored by the local Title IV-E agency to ensure that model fidelity is maintained where an EBP is being used. Where model fidelity does not dictate a prescribed caseload size, ongoing assessment of family needs and the time invested in the family\u2019s service or intervention must be taken into consideration to prevent caseloads from becoming unmanageable. Prevention caseload numbers will be tracked through CWS-CARES and available for analysis throughout the continuous monitoring of the FFPS program. Local Title IV-E agencies will describe in their CPP additional local strategies or protocols for how caseload size and type for prevention caseload size and the type of prevention case assignments will be determined, managed, and monitored.

In July of 2021, California\u2019s Family First Prevention Services Program (FFPS) was established in WIC \u00a716585 through 16589 as an opt-in program for county and tribal Title IV-E agencies to develop and implement Title IV-E prevention services as part of the continuum of comprehensive prevention and early intervention services supporting child and family well-being. In accordance with state statute, local Title IV-E agencies will be provided the option to participate in the Title IV-E Prevention Program. To supplement the state\u2019s efforts to build evidence-based prevention programming, through the passage of AB 153, California has provided local county agencies an additional $199 million through a state-funded block grant to support local efforts to expand to a full continuum of prevention services through the development of local comprehensive prevention plans (CPPs).

Ultimately, the ten (10) EBPs chosen are all well-supported EBPs in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse and listed in Appendix A. For each of these EBPs, California is requesting a waiver of the evaluation requirement due to the compelling effectiveness of the practices and adherence to continuous quality improvement processes included in the design. Because not all services requested by stakeholders were able to be included in the current Prevention Plan, CDSS may support additional prevention services and programs for evaluation in the future, including those which are rated as \u201csupported\u201d or \u201cpromising\u201d but lack sufficient evidence to be rated in the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse as \u201cwell supported\u201d. During an annual planning process, the CDSS will consult with opt-in agencies to identify additional programs and services that align with the statewide prevention strategy, have demonstrated outcomes with specified target populations, and have the potential to meet the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse criteria.

In addition, jurisdictions participating in the state\u2019s Family First Prevention Services Program will be able to supplement Title IV-E prevention services with culturally appropriate programs not yet eligible for Title IV-E reimbursement using additional funds that are provided to those counties who opt in. Funding from other sources supporting prevention activities can be leveraged to accomplish these goals, including use of state funds through the Family First Prevention Program state block grant.

Therefore, cross-system coordination, collaboration, and practice are critical to meeting the goals of FFPSA. The following innovations reflect California\u2019s investment in cross-system practice:\n\n# Integrated Core Practice Model\n\nGrounding cross-system work at every level is the statewide Integrated Core Practice Model (ICPM).18 The ICPM is a practical guide to support county child welfare, juvenile probation, behavioral health agencies, and community partners to improve delivery of timely, effective, and integrated services to children, youth, and families. The ICPM requires a commitment to shared values and practices, building positive, respectful relationships across systems with youth and family members, and recognizing and appreciating the value of differing perspectives and accountability to achieve a shared vision. 18 CDSS The Integrated Core Practice Model (ICPM) Resource, The Integrated Core Practice Model (ca.gov)\n\nPage 17\n\n# Continuum of Care Reform\n\nIn 2015, the Continuum of Care Reform (CCR), (Assembly Bill 403 (Chapter 773, Statutes 2015), provided the statutory framework to ensure services and supports are focused on maintaining stability for foster youth in a permanent home, and reducing the use of congregate care facilities. 19 To achieve these outcomes, the CDSS has implemented a number of reforms, including the expanded use of Child and Family Teams (CFTs) to develop family-driven, child-focused case plans and promote access and availability of services and support for home-based family care settings. The teaming model, a key component of the ICPM, can and should be extended to also support activities that prevent out-of-home care in the first place. # System of Care Reform (AB 2083)\n\nBuilding on the ICPM, California enacted Assembly Bill 2083 (Chapter 815, Statutes 2018) to guide county and state interagency coordination for children and youth in foster care.",

California has taken, and will continue to take, steps to improve and increase relevant trainings, such as cultural humility and implicit bias trainings, within child welfare agencies to reduce racial biases. In 2010, the CDSS received a federal grant to create the California Partners for Permanency Project (CAPP). The CAPP\u2019s goal was to improve permanency outcomes for all children and reduce disparities in permanency outcomes for African American and American Indian children in or entering Long Term Foster Care (LTFC). The CAPP implemented a Child and Family Practice Model (a precursor to the Integrated Core Practice Model now being used) that included culturally appropriate engagement; empowerment of family, tribal, and community networks; and use of culturally appropriate healing practices and practice adaptations.\u00b9\u00b3\n\nThe CAPP promoted strategies such as (1) ensuring the system becomes aware of, and more sensitively interprets, the cultural values and traditions of families being served as strengths; and (2) ensuring access to, and supporting use of, well-being and healing practices that are relevant and meaningful to the family and its culture. While these strategies were important in improving responsiveness to culture and trauma, CAPP also found that California\u2019s child welfare systems needed to be changed. Through the CAPP work, the CDSS discovered that in order to provide some of the more culturally appropriate supports that are needed for families to heal, the child welfare system must first develop or adapt internal business processes and fiscal mechanisms to effectively host and integrate those supports and services. Another important lesson learned from the CAPP Project is the level of investment needed for a sufficient, stable, trained, and well-coached workforce that can effectively deliver evidence-based or evidence-informed practices with fidelity. Without fidelity to the model, the child and family outcomes promised are unlikely to manifest.",
