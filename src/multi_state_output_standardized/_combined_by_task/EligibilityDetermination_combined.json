        "description": "Eligibility for Title IV-E prevention services in California is determined through a multi-step process involving assessment and review by the local Title IV-E agency. Families may be referred through various pathways, including self-referral, referral by public or private entities, or by the Title IV-E agency itself. A contracted service provider (such as a Community Based Organization, Family Resource Center, or behavioral health agency) conducts an intake assessment to identify if the child may be at imminent risk of foster care. If so, the provider submits a referral to the Title IV-E agency, which reviews the request and makes the final candidacy determination. For probation youth, probation officers use specific assessment tools to determine candidacy and document findings in the case plan. All eligibility and candidacy determinations, as well as ongoing safety and risk monitoring, are documented in the CWS-CARES system. For Indian children, the Title IV-E agency must engage the child's Tribe in the assessment and determination process.",
