        "description": "CDSS instituted the Tribal Consultation Policy (TCP) in 2017 to guide consultations between the CDSS and the 109 federally recognized Tribes in California on policies and procedures that affect Tribes. The Five-Year State Prevention Plan\u2019s review adhered to the 2017 TCP. The CDSS established the Tribal Advisory Council (TAC) as a primary strategy to engage Tribes and tribal partners in CDSS initiatives. The Tribal Advisory Committee was engaged to solicit input and convened in fall/winter 2021. CDSS entered consultation with the Yurok and Karuk Tribes to determine how the IV-E prevention program will be incorporated into their existing Title IV-E agreements.",
